q1,AR,0,"Generation, transmission and distribution are independent in Argentina under the law 24.065. Among utilities, Pampa Holding is a vertically-integrated company, acting in the three sectors; Endesa acts in the generation sector and owns Edesur; AES acts in the generation sector and owns Edelap. However, no utility monopolises the country's power market. "
q1,BB,2,"Light & Power Holdings is an investment company with electricity as its core business. It owns the Barbados Light & Power which controls generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Barbados.The company has been serving electricity customers in Barbados since 1911. Electricity service is available to the entire island community."
q1,BD,1,"Generation, transmission and distribution is undertaken by separate companies, most of which are state-owned. The Bangladesh Power Development Board, a part of the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, oversees the sector and is the single buyer. It also operates a number of mainly urban distribution networks and most of the country's generation. Transmission is carried out by the monopoly state-owned Power Grid Company."
q1,BO,0,"The country’s power sector is mostly served by recently nationalized companies responsible for generation, transmission and distribution."
q1,BR,0,"In 1995, Brazil conducted a power sector reform, which required all power companies to have separate businesses for generation, transmission and distribution. It also opened the market to private companies. Before 1995, state-owned company Eletrobras had a market monopoly"
q1,BS,2,"Two companies monopolise the power sector in Bahamas. The Bahamas Electricity Company controls generation, transmission and distribution in Bahamas and Grand Bahamas (private company) controls generation, transmission and distribution in Grand Bahamas island."
q1,BW,2,"There are no plans to unbundle the value chain, although IPPs at the generation level are being encouraged.  "
q1,BZ,1,"There are at least five different generators, but Belize Electricity Limited (BEL) is the only buyer, distributor and transmission company in Belize."
q1,CD,2,"The 2014 electricity sector law provides for unbundling by opening up different parts of the value chain to private participation. Effectively however, national utility SNEL still remains the dominant player, combining generation, transmission, distribution and sales. Also, practically, unbundling is difficult given the fragmented nature of the country's power system. This means that often the role of generator and distributor is handled by the same company."
q1,CI,1,"Cote d’Ivoire’s power sector was fully unbundled by the Electricity Act of 2014. However, the private company CIE, in which the government has a 15% stake, is licensed to operate the country’s transmission grid and as the sole distributor and retailer of electricity until 2020. Thereafter, the government will still have a monopoly in power dispatch, but may choose to license a private operator to take on these responsibilities. Generation has been fully liberalised since 1994 and private developers already own twice as much generation capacity as the government, which limits itself to hydro assets.    "
q1,CL,0,"Chile's electricity sector has been unbundled, leaving distinct actors in generation, transmission and distribution."
q1,CM,1,"Eneo Cameroon (the new name for AES-Sonel following its acquisition by Actis, a private equity investor) is an integrated utility. There are two independent power producers (IPPs) - Kribi Power Development Corporation (KPDC) and Dibamba Power Development Corporation (DPDC) - which were acquired in 2014 by Globeleq, which is controlled by Actis. The 2011 Electricity Law paves the way for unbundling and creation of a publicly-owned transmission company. The law was also designed to attract additional private investment in generation."
q1,CN,1,"The power sector in China is still essentially a monopsony (a market in which there are many generators, but only one buyer). There are several giant state-owned enterprises in the generation segment, as well as many smaller private players, particularly in the renewable sector. Monopoly grid companies have traditionally controlled transmission, distribution and retail. However, as of 2016, the private sector is allowed to invest in distribution grids and participate in the retail market."
q1,CO,0,"The electricity sector in Colombia has different private and state-owned players for all four sectors (generation, transmission, distribution and retail). There is also a large number of players in the off-grid area. EPM (Empresas Publicas Medellin) is one of the largest players, participating in the entire power market of Colombia."
q1,CR,1,"The power market in Costa Rica is regulated under the law 7593 of Aresep. It is regulated and dominated by the vertically integrated Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), which is the major generator  of Costa Rica and the sole power purchaser in the country. According to its law, ICE is responsible for national energy demand. The Costa Rican market includes private players, in the form of cooperatives involved with generation and distribution in parts of the country and as independent power producers, selling electricity to ICE. "
q1,DO,0,"The Organismo Coordinador del Sistema Elétrico Nacional Interconectado (OC-SENI) was created in 1998 to coordinate the electricity generation, transmission and distribution companies. There is no vertically-integrated monopoly utility in Dominican Republic,DO, and the power sector is unbundled."
q1,EC,0,"Ecuador's power market is controlled by state-owned utility Corporación Eléctrica del Ecuador (Celec), responsible for transmission and most of the generation. CELEC is not involved in the distribution sector, where the main players are CNEL, Electrica de Guayaquil and other nine regional companies."
q1,EG,1,"Egypt has formally unbundled the former vertically integrated Egyptian Electricity Authority. But in practice, the power sector remains principally in the hands of the state-owned Egyptian Electricity Holding Company (EEHC), or rather its six subsidiaries for power generation, the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC), and its nine subsidiaries for electricity distribution and retail. Private-sector participation has been allowed through three build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) contracts and some other very small IPPs. But, the electricity law issued in June 2015 will transform the current market set-up into a competitive one based on bilateral contracts plus a regulated market. An independent transmission system operator will be created and unbundled from the other participants."
q1,ET,1,"Technically, the sector has been partially unbundled, but it continues (for the time being) to operate under a vertically-integrated entity. One could argue that the Ethiopian market is effectively still bundled. In December 2013, the government initiated a split-up of the vertically-integrated Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) into Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP), which controls transmission and generation – currently it operates all grid-scale plants in the country – and Ethiopian Electric Services (EES), which is in charge of retail sales and distribution. Both are state-owned and, as of June 2016, are still governed by the same board of representatives."
q1,GH,1,"Prior to 2008, the government-owned Volta River Authority (VRA) was wholly responsible for electricity generation, transmission and distribution throughout Ghana. Under reforms begun in 2005, the VRA was restricted to power generation, while the Ghana Grid Company (GridCo) took over transmission. Distribution is carried out by state-owned companies, the Northern Electricity Department (NEDco) and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG). The government has interests in four independent power producers (IPPs)."
q1,GT,0,"All the segments have distinct actors, especially in generation where more than 80% of the players are independent power producers."
q1,GY,1,"Guyana’s electricity market is controlled by the state-owned Guyana Power and Light (GPL), a vertically integrated company responsible for electricity distribution, transmission and part of generation. The country’s market also includes independent power producers, which must sell electricity to GPL. "
q1,HN,1,"On 20 May 2014, a new electricity law came into force in Honduras. The law regulates the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Honduras,HN, as well as the operation of the national electricity system. It determined the end of ENEE's monopoly and allowed greater participation of private players in the power market.  The is a first step for participation of private players. However as of June 2016, besides an electricity tariffs increase, no new policy had been published to regulate electricity sector activities. The CREE will be responsible for granting licences to new players and regulating the market."
q1,HT,1,"Electricité d'Haiti (EdH) is the country's utility company responsible for part of Haiti's electric power generation, transmission, and retail distribution. According to The Haiti Sustainable Energy Roadmap, ""although EDH has its own generation park and technically holds a monopoly over the country's electricity system, most power is currently produced by independent power producers, including Sogener, E-Power, and Haytrac. IPPs have been operating in Haiti's electricity sector since 1996. The first to sign a contract with EDH was Interselect SA in Cap Haitïen in 1996. Outside of Port-au-Prince, Sogener signed two power purchase agreements in 2002 for a total installed capacity of 16MW: Cap Haïtien (8MW) and Artibonite (8MW). Haytrac currently operates two plants with a total installed capacity of 12MW: Petit-Goâve (6MW) and Les Cayes (6MW). Following the earthquake in 2010, E-Power entered the market with a 30MW heavy fuel oil diesel power plant in Port-au-Prince."" "
q1,ID,2,"The Indonesian power sector is dominated by the vertically-integrated state-owned utility PLN and its regional subsidiaries. Independent power producers (IPPs) and suppliers are legally able to operate, but apart from some activity by a small number of generators such as Supreme Energy, the majority of the value chain is still bundled.  "
q1,IN,0,"PGCIL is a central government-owned company that operates five regional electricity grids and solely handles inter-state electricity transmission in India.

q1,JM,1,"Private utility Jamaica Public Service (JPS) is in charge of 60% of generation, and 100% of transmission and distribution services in the island. Other players may enter the market as independent power producers and sell electricity to JPS. JPS is owned by Japan-based Marubeni Corporation at 40%; South-Korea-based Korea East-West Power at 40%; the Government of Jamaica at 19.9%; and some 3,000 shareholders holding the remaining 0.1% of the shares. Five companies generate electricity to the grid, but JPS is the only buyer.  "
q1,JO,0,"Distinct actors exist for different phases of energy production/transmission and distribution. There are a number of generators, but a monopsony exists where there is only one buyer. National Electric Power Company (Nepco), the single bulk buyer of energy from the generators, is in charge of transmission. Distribution is then handled by three companies, each serving a region in Jordan: Electricity Distribution Company (EDCO), Irbid District Electricity Company (Ideco) and Jordanian Electric Power Company (Jepco). "
q1,KE,2,"Kenya has 20 licensed independent power producers (IPPs) feeding power into the grid. Of these, KenGen is by far the largest, contributing more than two-thirds of total consumed electricity. Kenya Power owns and operates most transmission lines, while Ketraco has been licensed to develop new lines. Kenya Power is the only distributor of power, with the single exception of PowerHive, a mini-grid operator that received the country's first private distribution license."
q1,LB,2,"Lebanon’s utility, Electricité du Liban (EDL), has a monopoly for transmission, distribution and retail of electricity in the country. On the generation side, independent power producers are authorised by law but it is unclear which institution is mandated to award licenses. Consequently, new generation capacity from IPPs has been very limited."
q1,LK,1,CEB is owned by the government and has a monopoly in the transmission and distribution of power. It is also the country's single largest power generator. 
q1,LR,2,"The 2015 Energy Law is designed to unbundle the country's generation and distribution segments, but no distinct actors have entered the market yet. Procedures and by-laws to enable full unbundling to take place still need to be created. Theoretically, the generation and distribution segments of Liberia's power sector are liberalised as private players can enter the market and work with the independent energy regulator to arrange optimal PPAs. However, the Liberian Electricity Corporation remains the only active player in the country's generation, transmission, distribution and retail segments."
q1,MM,0,"he generation segment includes government-controlled entities and independent power producers (IPPs). The transmission segment is state-controlled. There are three main distributors, all government-controlled, which serve the Yangon and Mandalay regions and the grid-connected areas outside of those regions."
q1,MW,2,"The power sector is vertically integrated. ESCOM, the national utility, provides all on-grid generation, transmission, distribution and retail. The unbundling of generation and transmission was announced in 2015 and expected to be completed by December 2016. A new state company, Malawi Generation Co, will be responsible for generation, while ESCOM will continue to control the transmission and distribution segments."
q1,MX,1,"One of the main changes introduced by Mexico's energy reform is the separation of state-owned vertically integrated utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), which holds the vast majority of generation assets and has monopoly over transmission and distribution. In January 2016, Mexico's Ministry of Energy (Sener) issued the decree that guides CFE's unbundling and creates different companies for generation, transmission and distribution. CFE's business separation is still ongoing. "
q1,MZ,1,"EDM is the sole actor in the transmission, distribution and retail markets, and dominates the generation market. There are independent power producers."
q1,NG,0,"The only part of the power sector that has not been fully privatised is transmission. The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) was managed by Manitoba Hydro, a canadian company, but is now being managed by TCN staff who were trained by Manitoba Hydro."
q1,NI,0,Nicaragua's power sector is unbundled and distinct actors participate in the generation and distribution sectors.

q1,PA,0,"Panama's electricity sector has been unbundled, having distinct actors in generation, transmission and distribution."
q1,PE,0,"There are several generation, transmission and distribution companies in Peru. Generation, transmission and distribution are both legally and practically separated. In the early 1990s, the Peruvian power sector was unbundled, opened to private sector investment, and regulatory models were established for each segment. "
q1,PK,0,"There are a number of state- and privately-owned companies in generation, transmission and distribution. There is a vertically integrated private sector company that handles all three - generation, transmission and distribution - in and around Karachi. In the rest of the country, there are different actors for generation, transmission and distribution. There have been independent power producers (IPPs) in the generation sector historically, and the government plans to introduce private players to the transmission and distribution sector. While some private players now have distribution and transmission licences, most of power is purchased directly by the National Transmission Despatch Company Limited (NTDC). "
q1,PY,2,"Administración Nacional de Electricidad (ANDE) manages generation, transmission and distribution. The same organization also determines retail prices. "
q1,RW,1,"State-owned REG was incorporated in 2014 (Law 97/2013). One subsidiary, the Energy Development Corporation, focuses on transmission and development of new generation capacity (either by itself or by tendering with IPPs), while another, the Energy Utility Corporation, operates existing assets, manages retail and is power off-taker for IPPs. Generation is fully liberalised and the large majority of projects are being developed by IPPs."
q1,SL,1,"The National Electricity Act, 2011 established the unbundling of the state-owned integrated utility (Sierra Leone's National Power Authority) into: (i) the Electricity Generation and Transmission Company (EGTC); and (ii) the Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority (EDSA). This became effective in 2015. "
q1,SN,1,"Senelec, Senegal's national power company, continues to control transmission, distribution and retail of electricity in the country, apart from in rural electrification concessions where concession holders handle retail and distribution. Senelec has a monopscony until 2019 on the wholesale buying and selling of electricity. From 2019 onwards it may be possible for individual generators like Kououne Power to sell power directly to another stakeholder, depending on what happens in future legislation. Energy generation on the central grid system comes primarily from thermal power stations - Bel-Air and Cap-des-Biches, located close to Dakar, and the Kahone diesel power stations located in Kaolack, as well as from a hydro-electric dam located in Mali. In 2016, Senelec controls 74% (432.9MW) of the generation market with three private actors: Kounoune Power (67.5MW of diesel), Manatali (66MW of hydro from Mali, derived from the Senegal river) and Felou (15MW of hydro from Mali). The market share of independent power producers will increase in coming years as new solar and wind projects come online. 50 megawatts worth of solar PV projects are currently under construction and will connect to the grid at the by latest Q1 2017, and another 70MW worth have agreed contracts with Senelec. A 150MW wind project also has a contract signed and is awaiting financial close. Renewable energy development is seen as an important tool to meet energy deficiencies and contribute to reduction of poverty. The country benefits from 3,000 hours of solar irradiation on average per year, and an average wind strength of 5 meters per second. New conventional power projects: A new 125MW coal power station will come online in January 2018 on the Sendou site, developed by Conseil Economique et Social Sénégal (CES), with another 125MW expected to be added in January 2020. It is being financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB), a local bank and SMO - a Netherlands fund. Power will be sold to Senelec. Senegal has also recently discovered gas reserves off the Saint Louis coast, estimated at 450bn cubic meters, which is expected to be available from 2022. In expectation of this, new power stations are being built with capacity to operate both fuel and gas (once it becomes available). A new 52MW diesel power station at Cap des Biches is also expected to be operational from June 2016, developed by US company Contour Global, with a 30MW extention expected for January 2017. Senelec has also signed a contract with Tobene Power to build a 70MW diesel power station to be located at Taiba NDIAYE, with a 35MW extension forecast for January 2017."
q1,SR,1,"Suriname’s electricity market is controlled by state-owned Energiebedrijven Suriname (EBS), a vertically-integrated utility that controls transmission, distribution and 41% of the country’s generation capacity. Most of the remaining share is generated by the state-owned oil company, Staatsolie, and a private mining company, Suralco. According to IDB, EBS operates seven isolated systems in Suriname,SR, serving over 145,000 customers. The Energie Voorziening Paramaribo (EPAR) is the largest of EBS’s power systems, serving over 129,000 customers in the Paramaribo and surrounding areas. EBS shares its responsibility for rural electrification with the Dienst Electrificatie Voorziening (DEV), the Ministry of Natural Resource’s department of rural energy, which operates a total of 6.2MW small power systems in isolated and remote communities where EBS networks do not reach customers."
q1,SV,0,"In 1999, the Ley General de Electricidad unbundled and restructured the Comisión Ejecutiva Hidroeléctrica del Río Lempa (CEL), separating generation, transmission and distribution assets. CEL stayed only at the generation level, with competition open to private players, Etesal was created to be in charge of transmission, and distribution was open to private competition."

q1,TZ,1,"State-owned and vertically integrated Tanesco continues to dominate the power sector, holding a monopoly over transmission and an oligopoly (with Mwenga Hydropower) over distribution and retail. In principle, the generation market comprises eight companies, but in practice Tanesco has more than half of the generating capacity in Tanzania. "
q1,UG,0,"The Ugandan Electricity Board was unbundled into separate entities for generation, transmission and supply through the 1999 Electricity Act, which also saw the creation of the Electricity Regulatory Authority. UMEME, a privately owned company, was granted a 20 year supply concession by the state owned Uganda Electricity Distribution Company. New sections of the distribution grid are granted under concession to UMEME or one of the other regional suppliers depending on location. Uganda is one of the few sub-Saharan countries with an unbundled power sector."
q1,UY,1,"Uruguay's electricity sector is a monopsony, where there are many generators (including private and public companies), but one vertically-integrated utility company, known as Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones Electricas (UTE), controls part of the generation market, and 100% of transmission and distribution."
q1,VE,2,"According to the presidential decree 5330 from July 2007, Corpoelec is a state-owned company in charge of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retail in Venezuela. Corpoelec originated from a fusion of 14 regional state-owned companies. "
q1,VN,1,"EVN and two other state-controlled companies, Vinacomin and PetroVietnam,VN, control 78% of all generation. Independent power producers (IPPs) provide around 16% of generation, mostly in the form of large coal-fired power projects. Private companies are engaged in the sector via the build-operate-transfer model, whereby the asset is operated by the IPP for a period of time, but eventually reverts to EVN. A competitive wholesale market is being piloted, with the aim of being operational by 2021. There are also plans for a competitive retail market by 2023. "
q1,ZA,2,"Eskom, the national utility, is responsible for the majority of power generation in South Africa,ZA, with a fleet of coal power stations. Independent power producers have started to capture market share, mostly by adding renewable power assets to the grid. There are plans in place to add privately-owned coal and gas generation capacity in the coming years."
q1,ZM,0,"The state utility, Zesco, has operations in generation, transmission, distribution and retail, and controls the majority of electricity in these areas. There are a few companies that provide independent generation and retail. Sector liberalisation in the 1990s meant that it would be legally possible for a private company to run transmission or distribution networks. The Copperbelt Energy Corporation is one example, running a transmission grid in the north of the country (see the Zambia Energy Regulation Act)."

q2,BZ,2,"BEL controls transmission, distribution and a small part of the generation market in Belize."
q2,CD,2,"The Electricity Law of 2014 was enacted in June 2016 opening the door to private ownership of generation and distribution assets. For now, however, government-owned Société Nationale d'Electricité (SNEL) remains the only significant player in generation, transmission and distribution. Some private companies are active in generation and distribution, however these are mostly isolated cases. Private participation can happen through concessions, licensing, authorisation or simple declaration, depending on the nature of the activity."
q2,CI,1,"Generation was liberalised in 1994 and is the only segment of the power sector in which separate private companies are active. The country's three private generators are entirely fossil fuel-based and own about twice as much capacity as the government, which has only hydro assets. Transmission and distribution is fully owned and operated by the private Compagnie Ivoirienne d’Electricite (CIE), in which the government has a 15% stake and whose monopoly license runs until 2020. Thereafter, the 2014 Electricity Act provides that new licenses, limited in time and geography, may be awarded. This could see CIE lose its current contract covering the state-owned part of transmission grid."

q2,EG,2,"Most of the market power at each segment of the value chain is held by subsidiaries of the state-owned EEHC. One aim of the power-sector reform is to pave the way for gradual market liberalization. It is not yet clear how precisely greater privatization will be achieved in generation. The government may offer the capacity currently under development to the private sector, with the aim that by the end of the transition period, private capacity outweighs the state-owned installations belonging to EEHC."
q2,ET,2,"The generation and transmission segments have been legally dissociated from retail and distribution, with the state-owned Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) and Ethiopian Electric Utility (EEU) in charge of each, respectively. Privately-owned independent power producers (IPPs) have been invited to own their own plants (this has been permitted for over a decade), but no IPPs are yet in operation. Transmission, distribution (and retail sales) are still monopoly state-owned enterprises."

q2,SN,1,"Generation continues to be the only segment of Senegal's power system in which private companies operate. In 2015, Senelec controled 74% (432.878MW) of the generation market with three private actors: Kounoune Power (67.5MW of diesel), Manatali (66MW of hydro from Mali) and Felou (15MW of hydro from Mali). Senelec has a monopoly in all other segments of Senegal's power system. Exceptions are made for Senegal's rural electrification concessions. There, concession holders (a private company associated with an international donor in most cases) own and operate the generation, distribution and retail segments, while Senelec only owns and operates transmission.

q2,TZ,2,"There are seven privately-owned IPPs of various sizes. But government-owned Tanesco has the majority market share. It also has a 100% slice of transmission, and shares distribution with a hydro mini-grid operator. This set-up is due to change: the power-sector reform roadmap published in 2014 outlines how the country intends to move from a single-buyer model to retail competition. The first major step will be to take away the responsibility for distribution and retail from Tanesco by June 2021. "
q2,UG,0,"Generation, transmission and distribution are all run by legally seperate companies.

q3,EG,2,"The Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) was previously established as a private company of EEHC. However, as part of the power-sector reform, EETC will become a state-owned company independent from other electricity players, including EEHC. As well as more legal independence, EETC will also have more autonomy over market regulation."
q3,ET,2,"The grid is still operated as it was under the former vertically-integrated regulated utility, EEPCo. EEP is still the only generator (although a handful of IPPs are poised to enter the market) and it will remain the only transmission system operator, indefinitely. Economic principals (merit order) are in effect, by virtue of EEP's self-interest in dispatching as cost-efficiently as possible. However, with only one generator and very few plants with non-zero short-run marginal costs (very few burn fuel), the dispatching algorithms are much more basic than occur, for instance, under a dynamic independent system operator (ISO) arrangement with multiple IPPs. What few IPPs may come to exist will likely hand the keys to their plants over to EEP to operate. Thus, dispatching practices will continue to resemble what occurs under a vertically-integrated regime, despite some of the rhetoric around market liberalisation."
q3,GH,0,GridCo is the only organisation conducting transmission activities in Ghana. It is wholly-owned by the government and is independent of generation companies.

q3,HN,2,"On 20 May 2014, a new electricity law came into force in Honduras. The law regulates the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Honduras,HN, as well as the operation of the national electricity system. It determined the end of ENEE's monopoly and allowed greater participation of private players in the power market.  The is a first step for participation of private players. However as of June 2016, besides an electricity tariffs increase, no new policy had been published to regulate electricity sector activities.

However, Argentina's new president,  who has been in power since December 2015, aims to eliminate subsidies and raise electricity bills. Higher electricity tariffs are in force since February 2016."
q4,BB,1,"The subsidies are only applied through ad-hoc tax adjustment in case the end-consumer electricity rate is higher than the maximum rate established by the Fair Trading Commission. High rates are a consequence of the high cost of imported fossil fuels. Electricity subsidies, estimated using the price-gap approach, average 1.2% of GDP."

q4,BW,0,"There is a focus on making electricity available and affordable. As such, retail electricity prices are heavily subsidised for both domestic and commercial customers. However one of the roles of the planned Botswana Energy Regulatory Authority (BERA) is to regulate pricing."
q4,BZ,1,"According to the IMF report on energy subsidies in Latin America and the Caribbean, annual tariffs are set by the regulator on estimated fixed and variable costs and a surcharge/rebate to cover the gap with actual costs. The country has a subsidized electricity tariff for small consumers that consume less than 60kWh per month, called the social tariff. "
q4,CD,0,"The utility’s technical and commercial losses were close to 50% in 2013 and 35% in 2014. The average electricity tariff (at $6.6 cents per kWh in 2014) is the lowest amongst members of the South African Power Pool and well below marginal costs. To improve cost recovery, the government is targeting a gradual increase in tariffs to a level of around $8 cents per KWh for households on average, although individual prices are expected to vary by region."
q4,CI,1,"Cote d’Ivoire has regulated retail electricity prices. These vary by type and consumption of user and are applied uniformly across the country. Prices are updated frequently and kept at levels meant to ensure the financial stability of the power sector, a process established in law by the 2014 Electricity Act. The frequent increase of retail prices in recent years and the financial health of CIE confirm this. However, the setting of cost-reflective tariffs might become more of an issue as electricity sector license holders are bound to deliver on the government’s ambitious electrification plans enshrined in the 2014 law and domestic fossil fuel resources become scarcer. The prospect of continuously escalating tariffs and rising fossil fuel power generation costs (there are currently no significant gas import facilities) creates opportunities for non-hydro renewables that the government does not yet seem to be aware of."
q4,CL,2,"Under law 20040, Chile has a transitory subsidy applicable for up to six months for residential costumers when electricity rates increase more than 5%. This is the only subsidy in force in the country and, as it is not applied often, doesn't distort prices. "
q4,CM,0,"Power tariffs are calculated based on a cost-recovery formula. In recent years, the government has preferred to pay a subsidy directly to the power company rather than increase tariffs paid by consumers. Government subsidies amount to between 15% and 20% of the retail price."
q4,CN,0,Retail prices are determined by the government and include payments to subsidise large hydro and renewable energy generation projects.
q4,CO,0,"Residential prices have subsidies that range from 15% to 50% in the final tariff. The discounts are given based on ""socio-economic"" class, with lowest-income consumers receiving 50% discounts. This number falls as their income increases. "
q4,CR,2,Electricity subsidies for small consumers were eliminated in 2008.
q4,DO,0,"The Fondo de Estabilización de la Tarifa Eléctrica provides subsidies to electricity tariffs in order to keep them constant.

q4,EC,1,"Ecuador has a 'tarifa dignidad', which benefits consumers that use less than 110kWh/month in the mountains and less than 130kWh/month on the coast.  Approximately 4.3m clients enjoy this benefit. "
q4,EG,0,"This applies to low-income persons with a certified disability, who earn a monthly income of not more than $525 (TTD 3,500).     "
q4,ET,0,"EEU is a public entity that does not disclose its financials, so the full extent of subsidisation is incalculable. It is known that the state-owned distribution utility receives around ETB 2bn ($90m, using the 27 September 2016 exchange rate) each year in direct subsidies from the national treasury for rural electrification purposes, but these direct subsidies are less important than the indirect benefits that enable EEU to sell retail electricity at prices well below generation costs. Specifically, the cost of wholesale generation is indirectly subsidised by state backing of electricity infrastructure bonds for the construction of new power plants and transmission projects. State backing allows EEP to raise capital at extremely cheap interest rates (for example, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam was financed at LIBOR + 2%). These rates can yield negative real returns for investors, given that inflation in Ethiopia hovers north of 5% per year. Clearly, even with a government loan guarantee, EEP would be unable to raise capital at negative real rates of return without some sort of policy intervention. That intervention manifests itself as follows: legally, banks in Ethiopia are forced to allocate a portion of their capital (roughly one quarter) to state infrastructure bonds. Even with state subsidies, state regulators concede that retail prices will need to rise to align better with costs."
q4,GH,0,"All prices are regulated through the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC). In December 2015, electricity and water tariffs were increased by 59.2% and 69%, respectively. "
q4,GT,0,The tarifa social provides subsidies to small customers that consume up to 300kWh/month.
q4,GY,1,"There are a few specific subsidies, but not enough to affect the country's average electricity prices. There was a general subsidy to GPL customers, but it was cut in 2013, increasing electricity rates by 26.7%. In 2016, the electricity subsidy for senior citizens was cut. Linden, a former bauxite mining town, has benefited from subsided electricity rates. This results in a lower electricity rate to the town residents, compared to the country average. "
q4,HN,1,"Until December 2014, small customers (about 610,000 in number) didn't have to pay for electricity if they consumed less than 150kWh per month. In December 2014, the subsidies were eliminated and electricity tariffs started to reflect the real cost of electricity. Power subsidies are one of the reasons for ENEE's high debt levels. In June 2016, a second increase in electricity tariffs entered in force. From this month onwards, residential customers  with monthly consumption up to 50kWh pay $0.06/kWh (HNL 1.46/kWh). Residential custumers that consume from 51kwh to 500 kwh/month will pay $0.16/kwh (HNL 3.61/kwh). Low income customers who consume up to 75kwh/month are eligible to a discount of $5.28/month (HNL 120) in the total amount of their electricity bill."
q4,HT,0,"The government provides high subsidies to residential electricity tariffs. As a consequence, residential electricity rates in Haiti are among the lowest in the Caribbean and lower than generation costs for EdH and IPPs. However, commercial and industrial rates are very high."
q4,ID,0,"The Indonesian government sets consumer electricity prices below market levels to ease the economic burden for disadvantaged customers. Several tariff classes are subsidised, especially residential, business and industry customers with low voltage connections.

q4,KE,0,Retail electricity tariffs are fully regulated for all customer segments. The same tariff system applies to consumers on mini-grids that are operated by Kenya Power. These off-grid systems are therefore cross-subsidised by on-grid consumers.
q4,LB,0,"Retail prices have not been changed since 1994 due to their politicisation, and range from $29.5/kWh to $ 0.97/kWh. This is far below the cost of generation in a country that has had to rely almost entirely on oil imports for producing electricity.

q4,PK,0,"Subsidies and regulated pricing are features of Pakistan's power sector. Residential, commercial and industrial retail electricity rates are significantly lower than the cost of generation, transmission and distribution. A variety of subsidy mechanisms are used, including direct subsidies from the government, as well as cross subsidies and inter-distribution company subsidies. These help to create a uniform national electricity tariff for large consumers and a suitable national electricity tariff for low-income consumers. Electricity pricing is heavily influenced by national and regional politics and efforts to reduce subsidies have not succeeded in the past."
q4,PY,1,Paraguay has a social tariff program that subsidizes low-income families' electricity tariffs. 
q4,RW,1,"Rwanda’s retail electricity prices are not cost-reflective and are heavily subsidised. However, at an average of $195/MWh they are around 50% higher than the average in East Africa. Costs are high because domestic resources have not been fully exploited and, as a land-locked country, imports are expensive. To reduce the cost of generation the government is specifically targeting renewables and locally-sourced fossil fuels (peat and methane from Lake Kivu) as part of its 2015 energy policy strategy, which also aims to phase out indiscriminate subsidies and move to cost-reflective tariffs by 2018"
q4,SL,1,Sierra Leone's power tariffs are subsidised to some degree but the high price suggests they are somewhat linked to costs.
q4,SN,1,"Due to Senelec's dependence on imported fuel to run its power system, the production cost of electricity is closely tied to global commodity prices. The state has provided Senelec with compensation for the past few years due to the discrepancy between electricity prices and the cost of imported fuel. But since the last trimestre of 2015, Senelec no longer receives tariff compensation due to the recent commodity price drop. CRSE is also recalculating tariff prices for the 2017 to 2019 period, and it is possible that electricity prices for the general public will be lowered due to lower commodity prices. The electricity tariff is recalculated every three years and adjustments are made every annual trimester. If the difference between the maximum revenue and the actual revenue received by Senelec is plus or minus 5% then the tariffs are recalculated. Any changes less than this, then tariffs are left untouched."
q4,SR,0,"Suriname's average retail electricity rate is one of the lowest in Latin America and the Caribbean. Subsidies are estimated at 1.5-2% of Suriname's GDP. Additionally, consumers older than 60 years and consuming less than 150kWh/month can use the 60+ scheme."

q4,VN,0,"Raw fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas are subsidised, but generation of power is not. The overall effect is that the cost of electricity is artificially low. The government sets annual retail and wholesale rates at the beginning of every year.

Furthermore, BEC is not required to buy electricity from independent power producers (IPP). "
q5,BW,1,"In December 2007, the Electricity Supply Act of 1973 was amended to allow for independent power producers (IPPs). Still, without a proper framework or an independent regulator, participation has been limited to a single IPP operating a temporary diesel plant.

The office of regulator is currently being set up by the energy ministry, and is scheduled to be active and in place by mid-2017. As a transitional solution, applications by private companies to participate in the country's electricicity sector are handled on a case-by-case basis by the energy ministry. Although the National Agency for Investment Promotion (ANAPI) is assisting, this bilateral process is slow and unlikely to attract sufficient interested private companies. Also, public companies including SNEL, have reneged on contractual obligations in the past, increasing the counterparty risk for private companies. At least one private company has decided, in principle, not to take on any project that has public companies as a counterparties. In general, private investment is focused on areas with mining activities (private mining companies are seen as a reliable counterparties)."
q5,CI,1,"Cote d’Ivoire’s regulation is open to large and medium independent power producers (IPPs), but is not tailored to let in smaller loads. While the 2014 Electricity Act states that generation facilities used primarily for self-consumption may sell excess to the grid, the current interpretation of this article is that such agreements will be awarded on a case-by-case basis and thus primarily target large facilities linked to industrial activities.

The plan currently in force includes a list with 36 plants (5.2GW), mostly from Celec EP, that are expected to start operation from 2013 to 2022. The private sector may apply for permits for projects that were not considered in the PME. After the submission of a feasibility study, the project will be evaluated by Arconel. If approved, a PPA is signed between it and the private company. "
q5,EG,1,"Most of the land for renewables projects is government-owned and is allocated by the New & Renewable Energy Authority. While this may be helpful, the allocation process can be lengthy, particularly if multiple agencies are involved. Overall, some administrative processes could be streamlined, the government needs to localise international standards and there is a lack of awareness about renewables among consumers."
q5,ET,0,"Economics will continue to be a challenge for grid-scale IPPs, which must compete against a cheap mostly-hydro fleet that is indirectly subsidised by the federal government. This is why, in over a decade, we have yet to see a successful IPP project completed. For an IPP to operate in Ethiopia,ET, it would need to negotiate a power purchase agreement (PPA) with EEP. There is very little precedent for this, and the regulator (the Ethiopian Energy Authority; EEA) is still deciding on the details for determining an acceptable PPA price. For the existing fleet, for example, the EEA is still deciding how to distinguish between generation, transmission, and distribution costs. The generation-only component could be a benchmark upon which EEP could consider PPAs with IPPs. Retail prices (around $30/MWh) are much too low to support any new generation technologies, let alone the fact that the generation-only benchmark is a mere fraction of this price. Thus, economics (distorted by indirect subsidisation of state-owned generation) are a tremendous challenge for IPPs. It is true that the EEA will force EEP to consider PPAs at above-market prices (Reykjavik Geothermal’s Corbetti project has received a PPA priced at $75/MWh, for example), but the incentive to buy expensive electricity from IPPs rather than indirectly subsidised energy from EEP-owned projects is minimal.  Foreign exchange is another major issue for private enterprise in Ethiopia. There is a persistent shortage of foreign exchange in the country, since the Ethiopian Central Bank’s (ECB’s) monetary policy enforces a ‘crawling peg’ between the value of the Ethiopian birr and the US dollar. Essentially, the ECB limits exchange transactions in order to artificially inflate the value of the birr, to help limit its current account (import minus export) deficit, and to control against inflation. What this means for private companies is i) it can be challenging to import equipment into the country (there is a waiting list for foreign exchange transactions), and ii) it can be challenging to transfer domestic profits to a safer, less inflation-riddled currency than the birr."
q5,GH,0,"It is very difficult to get a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the government, according to developers. There are also generation and transmission risks, as reflected in the failure of the state to honour PPAs with existing generators or new prospects (how can the state fail to honour agreements with prospective IPPs?)."

q5,HT,1,"Although government allows private sector participation, many factors, such as lack of availability of financial investments, political instability and lack of regulations, make the generation sector unattractive to private actors. "
q5,ID,0,The largest barrier to private sector participation in the generation business is PLN's lack of willingess to act as an off-taker for power generated from renewable energy at a price above the average power production costs of PLN in the area. Utility-scale projects by independent power produers are only possible where they displace PLN's expensive diesel-fired generation.

q5,KE,2,The licensing process for IPPs is considered relatively simple. There are no major hurdles.
q5,LB,1,"Independent power producers are authorised by law, but it is unclear which institution is mandated to award licences. Consequently, new generation capacity from IPPs has been very limited. Historically, this situation has created a boon for retailers of diesel gensets and even, despite it being illegal, retailers of electricity produced by groups of diesel gensets. Together they are estimated to generate around 30% of the electricity consumed in Lebanon. This is creating opportunities for rooftop solar."
q5,LK,0,"The main hindrance for private companies looking to generate on-grid renewable energy is the application process itself. The key stumbling block is getting 'sign-off' from the CEB, which needs to verify grid connection. Other ministries also pose problems. New small hydro plants, for instance, need to get sign-off from the Ministry of Irrigation, while wind projects on the west coast had issues with the Ministry of Tourism. The CEB does also still control the amount of capacity that is offered to the private sector, and has kept a large chunk (100MW) of the proposed 375MW Mannar wind farm's permits for itself.   "
q5,LR,0,"The two major barriers to private sector participation in Liberia are the creditworthiness of LEC, which operates at a loss and is entirely donor-funded, and the lack of an independent energy regulator. The regulator currently resides within the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy and will not become fully independent until October 2017. This makes it difficult for an investor to be guaranteed a return on investment. With no regulator, an IPP risks financing a project with no guarantee that LEC can interconnect and buy all output from the project consistently. LEC's revenues have grown as its custmer base has increased, but its operating costs are growing even faster. It has had a negative net operating income for several years."

For instance, State Bank of Pakistan has reduced interest rates for new projects by around 45% in recent years."

q5,RW,2,"IPPs are at the heart of Rwanda’s ambition to grow its generation capacity to 563MW by 2018, up from 160MW in early 2015. The government has identified capital expenditure of $1.6bn to meet this target, including $167m for hydro nationally (86MW), $206m for hydro regionally and $103m for solar PV (40MW). Another $116.5m is budgeted to facilitate the development of geothermal projects (if sufficient resources are confirmed). The majority of these contracts will be procured through tenders, which have elicited high levels of competition in the past. The small hydro feed-in tariff is currently under review and is likely to be renewed and extended to more technologies (the 2015 energy strategy includes 26MW of new hydro and 12MW of combined solar PV and bioenergy capacity). All IPPs operate on 20- to 25-year take-or-pay PPAs, which protects them, to a certain extent, from problems in other segments of the energy sector. "
q5,SL,1,"Addax's bioenergy 14MW plant is the first IPP asset to be built, but it is yet to be fully commissioned. The PPA was negotiated with NPA and the ministry. The lack of grid capacity, particulary for intermittent supply sources, is a major barrier to an IPP. It is also took a solar developer four years to obtain a PPA, albeit that this period covered a change in ministry personnel and also the ebola outbreak. Such a long development cycle will hinder many smaller IPPs."
q5,SN,2,"There are no legal or official barriers to private sector participation in generation, nevertheless the structure of energy sector governance could be simplified to better drive the government's ambitious growth targets for energy. The environment for investing in Senegal is not currently adapted to fast and easy project development. VAT for renewable energy projects is suspended during the construction phase only, and is applied once the project starts producing energy. This creates a challenge for project developers because subcontractors do not benefit from the VAT removal. Contact between project developers and stakeholders like constructors, lawyers and debt providers can be slow and difficult, especially due to the sector's complicated governance structure. The wind and solar projects currently under construction lost time in negotiations due to a lack of renewable energy expertise on the part of Senelec."

Also, the process for securing the necessary environmental and social clearance is not transparent, causing delay."
q5,UG,1,"On the view that a number of speculators had entered the Ugandan energy sector, since 2015 the regulator has charged increasing amounts to hold site permits. Developers who fail to progress their projects may be fined and have their permits revoked. Missed deadlines can also be met by fines, but the process is not entirely transparent for developers. Additionally, due to the pipieline of projects due to be commissioned, the regulator is no longer accepting new applications for solar projects. Concerns over the ability of the transmission grid to absorb more renewables capacity may also limit prospects for developers."

Generation for direct use, whether it is for residential, commercial or industrial purposes, is authorised and supported by the government."
q6,SL,2,EDSA is the only player in distribution.
q6,SN,2,"Inside Senegal's main power system, Senelec, the national power company, is the only authorised retailer of electricity products. Inside rural electrification concessions, the concession holder is the only authorised retailer of electricity products. However, the growing market for off-grid products such as solar lanterns and solar home systems could mean that people in rural areas increasingly have a choice to retain control over their own energy production, instead of being limited to the concession holder or Senelec power tariffs. As many of these households rely on agriculture - which is dependent on unpredictable seasonal income - this option may become increasingly popular. Pay-as-you-go credit models will also help make these products more affordable."

q7,CI,2,"Cote d’Ivoire awards long-term “take-or-pay” contracts to IPPs. These are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and exclude fuel supply, which is provided by the state. This has allowed the country to successfully expand its fossil fuel power generating capacity and attract well-established international developers. For instance, it led to the successful negotiation of an ambitious 275MW hydro project with Chinese state-owned hydropower engineering and construction company Synohydro valued at around $500m, most of which will be covered by Chinese concessional finance. This deal is proof that the Ivoirian authorities are open to negotiations with developers of large projects. However, non-hydro renewable energy projects have failed to feature to date. The 2014 Electricity Act also provides for the establishment of a single public or private authority responsible for dispatch, opening the door for a wholesale power market. Progress towards a wholesale power market could be accelerated by the fact that new PPAs are unlikely to be awarded fuel supplies, which should increase visibility over generation costs and efficiencies.

To date, there have been just two IPPs, Azito Energy and CIPREL, plus the short-term power generation solution company Aggreko. The government is actively evaluating and developing new projects. However, progress is slow due to the case-by-case evaluation approach. "

However, generation is fully liberalised and the vast majority of future projects are being developed by IPPs whose contracts will be awarded competitively as the government looks to reduce the cost of electricity supply. If the government's plans fully materialise, then the state's share of installed capacity should shrink to less than one-fifth by the end of the decade."
q8,SL,0,"The only players in generation are EGTC and Addax, an IPP."
q8,SN,0,"In 2016, Senelec controlled 74% (432.9MW) of the generation market with three private actors: Kounoune Power (67.5MW of diesel), Manatali (66MW of hydro from Mali, derived from the Senegal river) and Felou (15MW of hydro from Mali). A previous 50MW fuel oil plant owned by GTI is being rehabilitated and is currently not in operation. Several sources said that GTI is being bought out by ContourGlobal LP. Over the next year, inclusion of several renewable energy independent power producers could change the generation mix considerably. Initiatives such as the IFC Scaling Solar programme could help to bring new actors into the market. A solar auction is due to be held. It will offer between 50MW to 200MW and will finance the winning bidders via equity or debt (or both) and will also validate project agreements to ensure they are bankable and ideally can be completed within 24 months from the launch date. The small size of Senegal's power system means that the concentration of the country's generation market could change rapidly if a small amount of private projects come online. In the long run, the implementation of the country's net metering law could contribute to the broadening of the generation base. "

The law regulates the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Honduras,HN, as well as the operation of the national electricity system. It determined the end of ENEE's monopoly and allowed greater participation of private players in the power market.  This is a first step for the participation of private players in the power sector. However, as of June 2016, no new policy was published to regulate electricity sector activities. The CREE will be responsible for granting licences to new players and regulating the market."
q9,HT,0,"Electricité d'Haiti (EDH) controls transmission and distribution in Haiti. As EDH lacks the capacity to provide electricity services throughout Haiti,HT, electrification efforts and minigrid development will need to involve independent producers, according to Haiti Sustainable Energy Roadmap. EDH’s legal monopoly over distribution has arguably limited investment. Explicitly enabling IPPs to distribute electricity in parts of the country where EDH cannot provide power would significantly accelerate renewable energy deployment. Arrangements allowing IPPs to produce power on EDH’s behalf have so far been negotiated bilaterally and in apparent conflict with the 1973 law granting EDH exclusive control over production, transmission and distribution. This has created a great deal of uncertainty and inconsistency for developers. In June 2014, the government launched an open call for local or international companies to assume EDH’s role in the Southeast Department. The successful bidder will be awarded a concession to generate, transmit, distribute, and sell electricity within that area, and will be obligated to improve infrastructure and add sufficient capacity to provide electricity to all inhabitants. Ultimately, this model could be expanded throughout Haiti,HT, with the exception of the metropolitan area. This pilot project marks an important step forward and an exciting shift in the structure and operation of Haiti’s electricity sector. "

q12,AR,1,"Argentina's credit-worthiness is low across all credit rating agencies. Cammesa and Enarsa are state-owned institutions and backed by the federal government. As a result, their credit worthiness is tied to the country itself. Ratings for private utilities are the following: for 2013 Edenor has low ratings: Moodys: Caa3, S&P: CCC-, Fitch: NR; Edesur only has ratings for before 2003, and Edelap has no ratings."
q12,BB,1,"Barbados Light and Power Company (BLPC) is owned by Light and Power Holdings Ltd. The comprehensive income of the group increased to $55.8M in 2013, compared with $44.6M in 2012. This jump is mainly attributable to a gain of $5.4M from the acquisition of Domlec, coupled with increased profits from BLPC of $3.4M. This was the net result of a decrease in operating expenses of $4.7M offset by a decrease of $1.3M in revenue from electricity sales. Despite a fourth consecutive year of declining sales (mainly due to constant net metering capacity additions), BLPC managed its operating costs while maintaining high customer satisfaction. In response, the company restructured its operations and launched a cost-saving initiative across the business"

q12,BR,1,"In spite of Brazil's downgrade and the revision of distribution companies' credit rating, PPAs are still bankable. "
q12,BS,1,"According to the IMF report: 'The Bahamas 2012 Article IV consultation', BEC continues to face financial problems. While the BEC benefitted from a rate adjustment in July 2010 (the first in seven years), its cash flow problems were aggravated by a three-year government programme (2010–13) aimed at alleviating the impact of high electricity bills on residential customers at a time of economic distress. Under this programme, all residential customers (irrespective of income) were able to stretch out bill payments over three years at very favourable terms. As a result, BEC’s accounts receivable decreased significantly — even as its payment for fuel inputs soared— forcing it to defer vital maintenance, take on additional loans, and accumulate arrears.  On the other hand, Grand Bahamas Power Company increased its profit and recorded $2.6m in earnings for the period of 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2013. Despite the GBPC profit increase, the credit-worthiness of offtakers was considered high because the private company owns only one fourth of the countries' installed capacity. The country's credit rating is stable."
q12,BW,1,"Whilst the BPC has been making a loss, it is state-owned and subsidised and therefore the offtake risk is not expected to be a barrier for IPPs."
q12,BZ,1,"Moody's ranked Belize as Caaa2 in June 2015. In June 2011, the Prime Minister announced that BEL (which was a private company) was bankrupt and didn`t have money to pay power providers. Subsequently, the government acquired the majority shares from BEL. The current major shareholders of the company are the government of Belize and the Social Security Board. At the end of 2013, the company recorded earnings of $18.7m, compared to a loss of $16m in 2012. Consequently, the company approved $5.5m in dividend payment to shareholders as of 31 December 2013. This represents a 60% increase in dividend payments compared to 2012. Energy sales grew by 4.7% to 483.9 GWh in 2013 from a year earlier. Operating cost per MWh sold decreased to $105 in 2013, compared to $112 in 2012."
q12,CD,1,"SNEL, the state-owned utility, is not solvent. In order to ensure power supply, some mining companies are financing and refurbishing SNEL generation projects. Their investment is recovered through future deductions in power bills. Other counterparties for private generators may include local governments or government-owned mining companies, who are not deemed reliable."
q12,CI,1,"IPPs operate under long-term take-or-pay contracts with CIE, which has a transmission and retail monopoly until 2020. This private company is financially sound and is owned by Paris-based holding company Eranove, which is in turn majority-owned by EPC Investments."
q12,CL,1,There are many private distribution companies in Chile. The two largest in the sector are in good financial health and have no default history: Chilectra (no short-term debt and credit rating of A-) and CGE (credit rating of A+).
q12,CM,2,"Eneo is the only offtaker. While prices are regulated and depressed, this does not necessarily have an impact on Eneo's bottom line as the government compensates the utility with a direct subsidy. Nevertheless, it remains vulnerable to changes in government policy."
q12,CN,1,"That said, discussions with developers reveals that the risk of missed payment is deemed low. The standard implementation agreement between UETCL and developers guarantees that the government will step in to ensure that UETCL meets any payments it owes."

q12,CR,2,Ba1 Moody's credit rating and BB+ Fitch credit rating. 
q12,DO,4,"The Dominican Republic's power market is unstable and presents high risks for independent generators. In the last years, a few events demonstrated the risks linked to the Dominican Corporation of State-Owned Companies (CDEEE), including: a) Omissions and lack of accounting records of financial transactions in CDEEE. In 2010, KPMG affirmed that it ""could not obtain evidence of sufficient appropriate audit"" and did not express opinions about the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to continue business. b) On 18 March 2015, the Dominican Republic Camara de Cuentas affirmed that the CDEEE is working to solve the omissions issue. However, as of July 2016, a new audit report still had not been published. c) In April 2015, the country's power generators, through the Asociación Dominicana de la Industria Eléctrica (ADIE), sent CDEEE a document with proposals for the fusion of the distribution and transmission companies. "
q12,EC,1,"In 2015, Ecuador's credit rating was downgraded by Standard & Poor's from B+ to B. Ecuador's distribution companies have significant level of debt and financial losses. "
q12,EG,1,"The Ministry of Finance guarantees all financial obligations of EETC under the PPA for projects over 20MW. The offtaker does not have a history of non-payment. In the longer term, there is a question mark over what happens when EETC is no longer a subsidiary of the Egyptian Electricity Holding Co. and therefore may not be covered by the sovereign guarantee."
q12,ET,1,"Once it has signed a PPA, an IPP faces the risk of default by state-owned EEP. Standard & Poor’s assigns a sovereign credit rating of ‘B’ to Ethiopia. The bigger risk for IPPs is the uncertainty of receiving a PPA in the first place, given the economic disincentive for EEP to sign offtake deals that are well above their (indirectly) subsidised generation costs."
q12,GH,4,"ECG is the primary purchaser of electricity in Ghana. It has struggled to meet payments required to honour PPA contracts with IPPs, a major reason for the delay in the roll-out of renewable generation in the country. The government faces significant macroeconomic challenges as low commodity prices have affected economic growth and infrastructure investment. "
q12,GT,1,No history of failure to pay and offtakers are financially stable.
q12,GY,1,"Despite the cash collection rate of 100% of 2012 sales, GPL’s operations had to be subsidized by the government to the tune of $30m (GYD 6bn) as a result of rising fuel costs and capital investment costs.  According to GPL's annual repport, the company remains creditworthy with excellent cash collection rates. No new debts were occasioned in 2012. Current debts attract low interest rates. The latest financial audit report available is from 2012."
q12,HN,4,"ENEE is failing to pay the feed-in premium promised to solar plants commissioned by 31 July 2015. The country’s power sector is going through a period of transition. The Central American country approved its new electricity law on 8 July 2014, which was to end ENEE’s monopoly and open generation to private players. It also created the independent regulatory commission, Comisión Reguladora de Energía (CREE). The new regulation was a result of the state-owned company’s high debt levels (1.8% of the country’s $18.6bn GDP in 2013) its need for power subsidies, its late payments and power losses. The new law aims to strengthen the country's finance and electricity sector. "
q12,HT,4,"Tariffs are so low that EDH cannot recover the amount spent to generate electricity. The country's inability to collect tariffs, its high transmission and distribution losses, along with political instability, lack of regulation and natural disasters, are other factors that make Haiti a very high risk country for investors. "
q12,ID,1,"The national utility PLN is the only off-taker for on-grid projects. PLN is heavily subsidised by the state and operates at a loss, which is why it has stopped signing power purchase agreements with IPPs aiming to build projects in non-remote areas. With the on-going restructuring of the utility and the spin-off of its renewables arm, the company is considered high risk."
q12,IN,2,"Electricity distribution companies in India had accumulated losses of INR 3,800bn ($56.9bn) and outstanding debt of INR 4,300bn ($64.3bn) as of March 2015. They have regularly defaulted on bank loans and are under considerable financial stress. The federal government has recognised this issue and launched a policy whereby state governments assume 75% of the debt held by the distribution companies, as it stood on September 2015. They will also take on future losses, but in a graded manner. The remaining 25% of debt is to be serviced by bonds issued by the electricity distribution companies. As of June 2016, 12 states had agreed to participate in the scheme, with more expected to join soon."

q12,JO,0,"The offtaker is Nepco and there is a sovereign guarantee behind its payments which is explicitly stated in the PPAs. Although Nepco has been running a deficit, it has not defaulted in any of its payments and this is not perceived as a risk for the investors. "
q12,KE,2,Kenya Power is considered to be a stable off-taker by most project developers. The company's probability of a default within one year is estimated at 0.36% by Bloomberg's proprietary default risk model (DRSK). Banks usually require project developers to obtain a 'government letter of support' to mitigate political risk.
q12,LB,1,"The politicization of the energy issue in Lebanon has meant that it has been simpler for authorities to finance the energy sector tariff deficit every year than to take measures that could improve the situation. As such, the solvency of Electricité du Liban is not an issue as it is backed by the government. "
q12,LK,1,The state-owned CEB acts as the sole off-taker for all renewable energy projects. There have been no instances of defaults or significant delays to payments for electricity and the risk is therefore considered to be very low.
q12,LR,4,"LEC is in debt and is entirely donor-funded, meaning there is very serious off-take risk. They operate on losses every fiscal year, and are currently spread thin working on four major transmission projects around Monrovia, so there is real concern about whether they could guarantee a connection with an IPP. Despite the country's signifcant demand for reliable on-grid electricity, it is questionable whether LEC could buy all the power generated by an IPP, were one to develop a project. With no independent energy regulator to enforce a PPA, the risk would be very high for an independent generator."
q12,MM,1,"There are no reliable reports of non-payment or default by offtakers controlled by the national government. To meet ambitious electrification objectives, Myanmar's state and regional governments may solicit power project tenders. The debt-servicing history of state and regional governments is limited."
q12,MW,1,"ESCOM has experienced financial problems in the past, but has now fully recovered. The new energy bill foresees creation of a guaranteed fund, supported by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, that will step in should ESCOM default and not be able to pay back the independent generators."
q12,MX,1,CFE has a credit rating of Baa1 from Moodys.
q12,MZ,4,"EDM does not have a history of agreements with independent generators. Since off-take contracts are not standardised, the negotiation process can be very long.  Technically insolvent, it has been reported that EDM relies on foreign aid. The utility has an uncertain future following a recent scandal involving undisclosed government loans."
q12,NG,1,"The risk for off-take contracts is low since all contracts are signed with NBET, a government-backed institution that acts as the main counterpart. The contracts are denominated in US dollars."
q12,NI,2,"Dissur and Disnorte, Nicaragua's main offtakers, are owned by Union Fenosa, which has a stable rating. Additionally, Moody's and Fitch upgraded Nicaragua's rating in 2015."
q12,NP,1,"The NEA operates on a deficit, apparently becoming loss-making since the 144MW Kali Gandaki hyrdo project came into operation in 2002. The government wrote off a NPR 28bn ($261m) deficit in 2011, but the utility has amassed another NPR 30bn ($280m) debt since then."
q12,PA,1,"Distribution companies and independent generators sign a ""guarantee  contract"" that guarantees payment to the independent generator in case the distribution company defaults. The distribution companies Gas Natural Fenosa (Edemet and Edechi) is rated as BBB+ and ENSA is rated as BBB by Fitch. "
q12,PE,1,Main offtakers are in a good overall financial situation. No information about payment default to generators.
q12,PK,4,"There is a circular debt problem in the power sector. Every actor in the supply chain has a substantial volume of accounts receivable, which prevents them from clearing their own dues. The government will need to improve visibility on its debt-service practices as it moves to meet growing power demand, which necessarily will require increased contracting with IPPs."
q12,PY,2,"Moody's and Fitch upgraded Paraguay's credit rating last year. (Moody's: Ba1, Fitch: BB)"
q12,RW,0,"There is no history of payment defaults from the off-taker, the 100% government-owned EUCL. IPPs operate under 20- to 25-year take-or-pay PPAs."
q12,SL,2,"NPA incurred losses every year from 2008 to 2012, needing grants from donors and government subsidies. However, the roll-out of prepaid meters for consumers by the government (50-70% penetration) means NPA is becoming more efficient at collecting revenues. Previously, the system relied on post-paid meters that were open to manipulation. Pre-paid meters also act as an energy efficiency mechanism as consumers become more aware of their usage. There are no soverign guarantees available."
q12,SN,1,"The lower cost of commodities has significantly improved Senelec's financial status. As of late 2015, the company stopped receiving compensation from the government and its balance sheet has improved due to better management, according to several developers. This has improved the risk perception among investors. Senelec's focus on diversifying its energy mix and bringing significant new generation onto the grid will make it less vulnerable to oil price fluctuations, which have been at the root of its financial issues in the past. Independent developers and financiers of the renewable projects we spoke to were confident that Senelec will honour long-term government-backed power purchase agreements."
q12,SR,2,"EBS faces financial challenges. In 2014, IDB approved a $38m loan for EBS to contribute to the sustainability of the power sector in Suriname. No information about payments default. In 2016, Fitch downgraded Suriname from B+ to BB-."
q12,SV,2,El Salvador's main distribution companies have Stable with A ratings from Fitch and Moody's.
q12,TJ,4,"BT has been making a loss for years and has been sued by non-state-owned plants for failing to make payments. According to a financial study by the EBRD and the World Bank, the utility's losses are increasing due to rising operating costs and high interest rates charged by local banks and despite a slight tariff increase in the recent years."
q12,TT,2,"T&TEC generates revenue to meet its recurrent expenditure. Expenditure is also met by capex and long-term loans. The Commission’s revenue for 2012 was an estimated $556m (TTD 3.7 bn), derived from tariffs ($525m or TTD 3.5bn), payment from shares in PowerGen ($16.8m or TTD 112m) and capital contributions from the rental of poles to service providers such as FLOW, TSTT, Tricod, among others ($12m or TTD 80m). T&TEC’s annual expenditure is currently $661m (TTD 4.4bn) and has a deficit of $105m (TTD 700m).  A new PPA was signed in December 2014 with Powergen, which will cover a period of 15 years and lower 77MW of capacity, which will generate savings at approximately $12.6m (TTD 84m) on an annual basis."
q12,TZ,4,"Tanesco continues to be classified as 'very high risk' this year, mainly due to its continued non-payment of IPPs. This has resulted in a cycle whereby the utility does not honour its payments; the IPP then seeks help from the Ministry of Energy and Minerals; a payment schedule is agreed and payment improves but not enough tp offset the debt; and then the cycle begins again. Tanesco is making efforts to pay off its debts in line with the 2014 roadmap, but it still operates at a loss and the plan to tackle its arrears is not yet clear. Unlike the banks, the IPPs cannot 'walk away', increasing the risk that payments to them will be pushed further out. "
q12,UG,1,"In 2011, due to a three-year decline in the value of the Ugandan shilling and a ballooning tariff deficit, UETCL withheld payments to generators, which shook investor confidence. Since then the structure of generation payments has been reformed, and the GET FiT premium payment and retail tariffs linked to the exchange rate and oil prices were designed to address concerns and minimise offtaker risk."
q12,UY,1,"Independent generators sign contracts with UTE, the sole state-owned utility in the country. There has been no history of default."
q12,VE,4,"According to local news, Corpoelec is 100% dependent on government financial support."
q12,VN,1,EVN is cash-strapped and has little liquidity to improve infrastructure or invest in renewables. It largely depends on cash infusions from the Ministry of Finance. Electricity rates are set by the central government and are not market-based. They have been kept artificially low to boost the industrial sector and expand electrification to residential areas.
q12,ZA,1,"Eskom has had well-publicised financial difficulties and has been making fervent attempts to raise the rates it can charge end users for electricity, attempts which the regulator Nersa has mostly tapered down. However, there was previously little need to worry about Eskom meeting it's financial obligations since, as a state-owned entity, it enjoys all debt being backed by the South African government. With the South African economy struggling and sovereign debt possibly facing downgrades to junk status, there is more pressure than ever on Eskom to prove that it can take care of itself."
q12,ZM,1,Zesco's financial position is not considered stable. It receives a sizeable amount of funding from government and most private projects need government guarantees. It is considered to be a somewhat reliable offtaker but is in the middle of a legal dispute after it unilaterally raised the tariffs on a PPA with a mine.
q12,ZW,1,Nyangani Renewables highlighted the fact that raising project finance against a PPA with ZETDC faces challenges over payment risk and credit worthiness.  Even the utility has highlighted that it is in a precarious financial situtation.
