q23,BD,0,Yes,The government is targeting the expansion of solar mini-grids through the IDCOL programme. For projects of 5MW or more a power generation licence is required and the tariff must be approved by the regulator in consultation with the government.
q24,BD,2,No,"IDCOL has secured development financing to rollout solar mini-grids, but the programme is at an early stage. So far, IDCOL has invited proposals for a set number of projects. The developers will identify appropriate sites, but IDCOL has agreed to help locate areas ""where grid electricity is unlikely to be expanded in the next five to 10 years""."
q25,BD,0,Yes,Projects of more than 5MW will require a license. Larger projects can also be proposed.
q26,BD,1,Somewhat,The Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) is becoming the one-stop shop for renewable energy developers. 
q27,BD,2,No,"Bangladesh Power Development Board does work on installing mini- and micro-grids of its own, but does not have a dedicated outward looking team to liaise with project developers. SREDA, however, does have a responsibility to ""promote, facilitate and disseminate sustainable energy""."
q28,BD,2,No,"So far, mini-grids have been subject to a limited call for proposals by IDCOL. The notice is available on the IDCOL website, but the application documents and other information (technical standards, grid connection agreements etc.) are not."
q29,BD,0,Yes,"Tariffs for grid-connected projects are determined on a case-by-case basis, with an upper limit of around $0.37 per kWh. The IDCOL financing programme heavily subsidises the capital and financing costs, so cost-recovery is certainly feasible."
q30,BD,0,Yes,"Mini-grid tariffs are stable, although still being in the pilot stage, their track record is relatively short. Larger IPPs have their tariff schedules listed for 15 years in their PPAs, including incremental capacity and energy remuneration components."
q31,BD,0,Yes,"Developers can implement their tariffs in a variety of ways, for instance using prepaid cards that villagers top up. This gives them flexibility in their business models."
q32,BD,1,Somewhat,"The Bangladesh Power Development Board has issued draft PPAs alongside requests for proposals sent to gas and other fossil fuel IPPs. However, this has not yet happened with renewable energy projects. The first round of solar mini-grid projects are being processed on a case-by-case basis."
q33,BD,1,Somewhat,"The government has a track record of signing bankable PPAs. For example, a 30MW solar project was offered a 20-year PPA. However, PPAs for renewables and mini-grids are uncommon as the sector is still in the early stages of development."
q34,BD,0,Yes,"The utility is obliged to take all the output for grid-connected projects, with the Bangladesh Power Development Board being the single buyer."
q35,BD,1,Somewhat,"Rules have been clearly defined for connecting projects to the grid. For mini-grids, there are no national standards, but some mini-grid developers have chosen to implement distribution networks that could be used for national grid electricity in the event of future interconnection."
q36,BD,0,Yes,"If the utility extends the grid to the mini-grid site, there are rules for them to buy power from the mini-grid or to provide sufficient compensation."
q37,BD,1,Somewhat,"Developers do not have access to grid plans. However, IDCOL clears mini-grid sites with the Ministry of Power, and they will not be approved if there are plans for grid expansion in the area."
q38,BD,0,Yes,"Solar home system distributers must adhere to quality standards that include warranty provision. Mini-grids are supposed to follow the standards of the national grid, although it is unclear whether this has been formalised by a technical committee."
q39,BD,0,Yes,The success of the solar home system programme is largely down to the financing that partner organisations are allowed to offer customers.
q41,BD,0,Yes,"The national grid extension programme has seen the number of grid connections more than double, from less than 1.5m in 2005 to more than 3m in 2015. IDCOL also enables off-grid electrification through development of solar home systems, mini-grids and irrigation pumps."
q42,BD,0,Yes,"The Rural Electrification Board was created in 1977 to oversee regional cooperatives called palli bidyut samity (PBS), which own and operate rural distribution networks. IDCOL oversees the rollout of off-grid and mini-grid projects through its solar financing programme."
q43,BD,1,Average,"The government allocated a total of BDT 8,109 crore to transmission and distribution projects in the 2015/16 budget, equivalent to slightly more than $1bn. This was part of a large increase in spending on the power sector (equal to double the previous year's allocation).  In relation of off-grid energy access, IDCOL disbursed BDT 2,355m ($29m) in loans to solar home system distributors and other renewable energy project developers."
q44,BD,0,Yes,"The government adopted a long-term energy strategy as part of its Vision 2021 plan, which envisages provision of ""electricity for all"" by that date."
q45,BD,0,Yes,"Bangladesh runs the world's most extensive solar home system programme for energy access, deploying more than 4m subsidised systems. IDCOL is now gearing up to deploy mini-grids and solar irrigation pumps too."
q46,BD,0,Yes,The IDCOL financing facility is central to the success of the programme. It allows distributers of solar home systems to refinance the cost of the system and microfinance loans offered to consumers over a longer tenor.
q47,BD,2,Low,"Fees are specified by the Rural Electrification Board and implemented by the PBS regional cooperatives - the connection costs are available on their websites. They appear to average around $20 for a household of five people, the average size in Bangladesh."
q48,BD,1,Somewhat,Grid connection is subsidised. The Rural Electrification Board applies government and donor funding to consumer connections as well as grid extension itself.
q49,BD,0,Yes,"The IDCOL programme includes grants for each system sold on top of its core soft loan refinancing mechanism, which subsidises the cost. There is also a capacity-building grant for partner organisations. There are various other incentives available for biogas and other small-scale renewable deployment."
q50,BD,0,Yes,"Solar products and batteries for home systems are VAT exempt. Solar products also benefit from reductions in import duties, whereas batteries are charged duties."
q51,BD,0,Yes,"We describe the IDCOL programme extensively in the relevant policy record. In addition, donors are trying to kick-start a market for smaller solar lanterns to reach the poorest people in rural areas."
q53,BD,2,No,"Mobile-enabled pay-as-you-go (PAYG) solar is at an early stage of development, but is likely to become more widespread in 2016. Business group Rahimafrooz is probably applying PAYG most innovatively. For now, its network of village sales agents are equipped with a smart phone sales app that allows them to collect payments, but consumers themselves are not able to use PAYG. The company intends to launch a new PAYG solar home system to fend off competition from cheap generics."
q54,BD,0,Yes,"Any solar home systems that suppliers want to sell through IDCOL's financing programme must be approved by the organisation's Technical Standards Committee. The committee has aligned its quality standards with those of Lighting Global, the World Bank's off-grid lighting platform. Missing for now are standards for smaller lanterns, and home system distributers alarmed by the growth of cheap generics are trying to extend quality standards beyond IDCOL's programme to apply on imports."
q55,BD,0,Yes,Kerosene and diesel prices are regulated by the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation and sold below cost-recovery.
q56,BD,2,Low,Solar products and batteries for home systems are VAT exempt.
q57,BD,0,Yes,Solar products and batteries for home systems are VAT exempt.
q58,BD,0,Yes,Solar products benefit from reductions; batteries are charged duties.
q59,BD,1,Somewhat,None reported.
q60,BD,1,Somewhat,Only SHS approved by IDCOL's technical standards committee can benefit from the financing programme - but market participants view this as important to main quality standards.
q61,BD,2,Low,"PV modules: Solar cells and modules are exempt. Solar Home Systems: Solar components are exempt. (Not under this code, but SHS approved by IDCOL are exempt.) Solar lanterns: Solar lighting products are exempt. Batteries: Batteries are generally charged 25%, with sealed lead acid charged 15%."
q23,BW,1,Somewhat,"It is legally possible to set up a mini-grid or small power project as nothing exists to restrict this. Although there is no policy governing the development of mini-grids or small power projects specifically, and there has been no evidence of such a policy since development of the 1998 Motshegaletau Centralized PV System, a pilot project. This was a 5.7kW centralised mini-grid PV system implemented by the Botswana Technology Centre (now Botswana Institute of Technology, Research and Innovation; BITRI). The mini-grid power station supplied 220 volts power to 14 households, a village clinic, a primary school as well as street lights.  Customers wired their houses and paid a BWP 500 ($90) connection fee. Tariffs were subsidised to the same level as grid electricity to allow the technology to take off. However, the grid was rolled out in that area making the mini-grid redundant. It was decommissioned in 2008."
q24,BW,2,No,"To date, this has not been encouraged as the focus has been on extending the main grid through the rural electrification programme. "
q25,BW,1,Somewhat,"There is no specific threshold for mini-grids or small generation projects. However, according to the Botswana Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act of 2007, projects for self-consumption below 25kW do not require a licence."
q26,BW,1,Somewhat,"The Ministry of Minerals, Energy and Water Resources - through its Department of Energy - handles regulatory approval, in consultation with BPC. Licences are required for all generation projects except if they are developed by state-owned enterprises, or fall below 25kW and are for self-consumption only."
q27,BW,2,No,BPC does not have a specific team to lead on the requirements for developers. Developers will be directed to the appropriate team within BPC depending on the project size. 
q28,BW,2,No,"There is no regulatory procedure established as yet that is specific to mini-grids or small power projects. The current process for setting up any generation project outside of the exception criteria listed above is as follows: the IPP is required to obtain approval from the Department of Energy based on its environmental impact assessment, it is then required to apply to the Department of Water Affairs for a grant of water right (which will be assessed based on a site visit to determine feasibility for connection). Finally, it must make a written application for an IPP licence to the Minister of Minerals, Energy and Water Resources, as per the Electricity Supply Act."
q29,BW,1,Somewhat,"The Electricity Supply (Licensing) Regulations (under section 15(1)) (26th November, 1993) specify that the IPP rates for the supply of electricity to consumers must be established in an agreement between the IPP and the consumer. However, the tariff must be approved by the Ministry of Minerals, Energy and Water Resources."
q30,BW,2,No,"There have been no power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed to date, aside from the five-year contract for the 70MW temporary generator - Matshelagabedi Alstom Power Rentals Plant - which was bought by BPC in March 2015."
q31,BW,1,Somewhat,"The Electricity Supply (Licensing) Regulations (under section 15(1)) 26th November, 1993, specify that the IPP rates for the supply of electricity to consumers must be established in an agreement between the IPP and the consumer. However, the tariff must be approved by the Ministry of Minerals, Energy and Water Resources."
q32,BW,2,No,No documents regarding structured PPAs exist.
q33,BW,2,No,"There have been no PPAs signed to date, aside from the five-year contract for the 70MW temporary generator - Matshelagabedi Alstom Power Rentals Plant - which was bought by BPC in March 2015."
q34,BW,0,Yes,BPC is required to buy all the output produced by grid-connected projects.
q35,BW,2,No,"The process and standards for interconnection are not yet developed, although efforts are underway."
q36,BW,2,No,Nothing exists to govern this as yet.
q37,BW,2,No,"There is no evidence to show that grid extension plans are made available prior to works being done. However, the list of villages connected to the grid is published by BPC once the work has been carried out."
q38,BW,2,No,No information was available to suggest that these exist.
q39,BW,2,No,There are currently no examples that this takes place.
q41,BW,0,Yes,"A Rural Electrification Programme has been in place since 1975. It was designed by the government with a goal to electrify at least 14 villages a year and extend the grid in 20 villages per year. A division of BPC is tasked with this, but funded by the government. Each year, BPC submits lists to the government - including cost estimates. In parliament, these are reviewed against the budget and decisions are made on how to proceed. BPC then implements the work. Initially, the programme was focused on grid electrification, but in 2010 BPC Lesedi was developed to augment this programme with a focus on off-grid and renewables. However this failed, partially because of mismanagement, but also because of errors in the business models. They were trying to rent the equipment, whilst the communities wanted to own it.  Despite the liquidation of BPC Lesedi, the grid electrification programme is ongoing. Furthermore, the Department of Energy has set up an SPV focused on renewable energy to carry out the mandate of BPC Lesedi on rural electrification and off-grid solutions."
q42,BW,2,No,"Whilst a seperate agency does not exist, there is a dedicated team within the BPC that focuses exclusively on rural electrification."
q43,BW,0,High,The 2016/17 budget was announced on 1 February 2016. It allocated BWP 257m ($24.3m) to the Economic Stimulus Programme (ESP) for rural electrification.
q44,BW,0,Yes,"According to the Vision 2016 document of 1997, the national access target is 80% by 2016 with 60% rural access. As at 2015, the rural access target had been surpassed and the national target was well on the way to being met. "
q45,BW,2,No,"There is no specific mention of off-grid and/or mini-grid options in the overall energy access target. Seperate targets were linked to the Renewable Energy-Based Rural Electrification Programme, introduced in 2005 and implemented under BPC Lesedi, although as at 2011, only 18% of the solar home system target had been met and less than 5% of the target for solar lanterns and efficient cook stoves. The programme was terminated in June 2014."
q46,BW,2,No,No evidence of current grant programmes or other funds allocated specifically to off-grid companies was found.
q47,BW,1,Average,"According to the National Electricity Standard Connection (NESC), the connection fee for each household in Botswana is fixed at BWP 5,000 ($494 using the average 2015 exchange rate) irrespective of location, but provided it is within 500m of the nearest distribution transformer. Customers located further away are required to pay the full cost of connection for line that lies outside the eligibility area."
q48,BW,1,Somewhat,"In April 2010, the government of Botswana introduced an electricity levy of BWP 0.05 ($0.5 cents) per kWh consumed. The levy is payable by all electricity customers to feed the National Electrification Fund (NEF).  The purpose of the fund is to subsidise household connection fees. In instances where the cost of a connection exceeds the fixed fee, the difference is covered by the fund."
q49,BW,2,No,"This is one of the barriers widely cited by players in the off-grid market in Botswana, including the SIAB and specialist vendors of off-grid products and systems."
q50,BW,2,No,"The standard VAT rate of 12% is applicable to off-grid pico-solar products, as confirmed via the newly-launched Botswana Trade Portal. And, whilst these products are exempt from import duties, so is all equipment and machinery used in the manufacturing sector, according to the broadly applicable Customs and Excise Duty Act."
q51,BW,2,No,"There were no market-building programmes as of 2015. However, on 18 February 2016, an MOU was signed between GIZ, SIAB (Solar Industries Association of Botswana), and the German Solar Industry Association to strengthen cooperation between Botswana and German companies in the PV and energy storage industries. A particular focus was to be placed on off-grid market-building."
q53,BW,0,Yes,"The system changed some three to four years ago and all domestic customers now use prepaid meters for electricity (although this is not the case for all commercial and industrial customers). There are hundreds of vendors for prepaid electricity, but the major vendors are 1) Botswana Post 2) Ideal Prepaid 3) Lowe Trade 4) Q Muzik 5) Sandulela. They, in turn, partner with sub-vendors thereby extending the options available to grid-connected customers.  In August 2015, Botswana Post launched a new mobile app that enables Andriod users to purchase prepaid electricity directly. In terms of off-grid systems, Videre Global are working with various ministries to pilot community energy hubs that involve solar PV powered micro-grids. One of the innovations being developed as part of the pilot scheme includes Botswana's first PAYG community energy scheme."
q54,BW,2,No,"The Botswana Bureau of Standards (BOBS) is the national body governing standards in the country. Whilst a number of standards exist in their catelogue relating to solar water heating systems and some relating to solar power systems, there is no mention of standards for small, portable solar products such as solar lanterns. Furthermore, solar standards that do exist are voluntary, which makes adherence by suppliers open to abuse. An influx of substandard products, particularly from Asia, have impacted the reputation of the market amoung end users. However, the SIAB is advocating for mandatory standards."
q55,BW,0,Yes,"According to the draft National Energy Policy, petrol, diesel, aviation fuel and illuminating paraffin prices are regulated by the government. Retail prices are stabilised using the National Petroleum Fund (NPF)."
q56,BW,1,Medium,The standard VAT rate of 12% is applicable to these products as confirmed via the newly launched Botswana Trade Portal.
q57,BW,2,No,"According to information obtained from the online Botswana Trade Portal, the standard VAT rate of 12% applies to these products."
q58,BW,2,No,"Whilst these products are exempt from import duties, so is all equipment and machinery used in the manufacturing sector, according to the broadly applicable Customs and Excise Duty Act."
q59,BW,0,Yes,"It should be noted that the movement of goods between Botswana and Zambia is subject to severe delays based on the current ferry system that can only transport a single goods truck at a time. However, there is nothing to indicate that this has been a barrier to the off-grid business as most products are imported from South Africa, with whom Botswana has close trade relations. Furthermore, a bridge is under development to address this problem."
q60,BW,1,Somewhat,"A trade license is required and whilst this is the case across most industries, it can be a challenge due to the long list of requirements needed to meet licensing laws. For example, one of the suppliers we spoke to noted a six-month delay due to a small written error in their application document."
q61,BW,2,Low,"All of these products are exempt from import duties according to the Customs and Excise Duty Act of 2004. This was both confirmed by the BURS representative at Gaborone international airport, as well as through the newly launched Botswana Trade Portal, where each product code was individually checked. In each case, only the standard 12% VAT rate is payable."
q23,CM,0,Yes,"It is legally possible to set up a mini-grid or small power project. However, so far, no private company has been willing to take ownership of a mini-grid concession, preferring instead to build the projects and let the government retain ownership and collect the payments. There is a lot of self-generation at the residential and commercial/industrial level, a large proportion of which is untracked, especially in the small hydro (less than 5MW) sector. "
q24,CM,1,Somewhat,"The government is keen to see mini-grid concessions develop, however thus far no developer has taken the risk. One project that seems to be veering away from a concession towards a licenced operator model (with the government owning the assets) is the 1.4MW Bakao small hydro project. The lack of a standard concession format (in no small part due to lack of pilot examples) is an issue. There is a small diesel genset-based concession at Yoyo run by GFDEE, but it was developed without government awareness and only later was it sanctified by the regulator."
q25,CM,0,Yes,"Plants have to be less than 5MW to qualify as rural electrification projects, which allows them to access specific support via the Rural Electrification Fund or qualify for direct funding by the Agence d'Electrification Rurale du Cameroun (AER). There is also a 5MW threshold for hydro plants looking to qualify as renewable (larger systems not considered renewable). Qualifying as renewable carries no direct financial benefits at the moment. Renewable projects count towards the country's renewable energy target and must be connected to the grid upon request if feasible and their energy must be taken if competitive, which is in itself a subject of debate and will probably be clarified as the government works to update the current energy law."
q26,CM,1,Somewhat,"The main actor is the Ministry of Energy and Water (MINEE), which holds the final decision power. However, a developer will still need to deal with a number of agencies, including the regulator Agence de Régulation du Secteur de l'Electricité Cameroun (ARSEL) and AER, among others."
q27,CM,2,No,There is no dedicated team at the utility Eneo. 
q28,CM,2,No,"There has been insufficient practice for this to be the case. Developers have to deal with a number of agencies, including the regulator, AER and so on. There is little standardisation, with officials at the regulator and ministry insisting that projects are considered on a case-by-case basis and negotiation is required each time. Consequently, most small projects are set up for self-consumption outside of regulatory control."
q29,CM,0,Yes,"There are no standard tariffs. The regulator, ARSEL, sets tariffs in accordance with a cost-plus calculation on a case-by-case basis. In Eneo's case, a revenue cap is taken into account, such that if Eneo's revenue exceeds the cap its tariff will be reduced the following year. For the only other concession in the country, GFDEE at Yoyo, the (considerably higher) tariff was agreed directly with the community and ARSEL subsequently rubber-stamped it (once it found out this project existed)."
q30,CM,0,Yes,"Eneo's tariffs are recalculated every year based on a cost-plus methodology, with a revenue cap. Every five years the methodology is reviewed, which represents a risk. It is unclear whether the same methodology is applied to other projects, but it does not appear to be the case that GFDEE's tariff is recalculated."
q31,CM,1,Somewhat,"There are no examples of different tariff structures agreed with the regulator. However, given the case-by-case basis for tariff negotiation, it may be possible to structure tariffs differently. In addition, different models are in use for the IPPs. For example, DPDC uses a tolling agreement, while KPDC uses a take-or-pay model."
q32,CM,2,No,"Eneo has only signed two active PPAs - with KPDC and DPDC. Since signing these it has gotten a lot smarter on the topic, especially as it has been asked for heads of terms agreements on PPAs from many of the developers of projects agreed with the government in memoranda of understanding.  Cameroon has had many (80+) memoranda of understanding for the construction of large power projects, often with the supposed developers having no intention of starting the project (sometimes they secure financing abroad that was subsequently used for other purposes). As a result, Eneo has developed a PPA checklist that project developers must adhere to before it will agree to any head of terms negotiations. From that point onwards, PPAs are agreed on a case-by-case basis with no standard model. However, the regulator is currently redesigning its models for concessions and licences for power generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity as part of broader electricity sector reform. Consequently, a (more) standard legal framework should emerge. Eneo is about to sign PPAs for the Nachtigal and Bakao projects and is starting negotiations for the 350MW Makay project."
q33,CM,0,Yes,"The KPDC and DPDC agreements are for between 15 and 20 years. The Nachtigal large hydro project under development will have a 99-year licence, although the duration of the PPA has not yet been confirmed."
q34,CM,1,Somewhat,"The Electricity Law of 2011 (No. 2011/022) requires renewable energy to be accepted by the grid, but does not specify a price or even a requirement to pay.  It is hoped that this ambiguity will be removed as part of the unbundling process and a system created whereby the grid is required to accept renewable power, but not non-competitive electricity. The possibility of making La Société Nationale de Transport d'Electricité (SONATREL) the country's sole buyer is under discussion."
q35,CM,2,No,"Standards are currently being defined. It is likely the country will adopt international standards, as used by Eneo, which for distribution connections are based on the French model. At a transmission level, the standards used will depend on the line in question. Given that some lines were built with funding from Spain, France and Canada among others, they used equipment from those countries and applied their standards accordingly. There are also standards at the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) level, but these have not been applied as the markets are not connected."
q36,CM,1,Somewhat,"The regulator has given assurances that concessions will stand for 15 years, regardless of the arrival of the grid. However, given the lack of proper case studies (the Yoyo project was developed without regulatory input), there is a lack of clarity around how developers are protected and what rights their concession entails. Each mini-grid would be considered on a case-by-case basis. For the Bakao mini-hydro project (which is unlikely to remain a concession), the options under discussion include compensation based on negotiation, or a concession for 15 years with the right to distribute and buy Eneo's energy in case additional power is required. The cost of purchase would be based on negotiation with Eneo."
q37,CM,2,No,"At the distribution level the grid extension plan is based on the number of additional grid connections made per year (the government set a target of 36,000 for Eneo in its contract), not on the number of villages or by regional expansion. There is no master plan and decisions are made between Eneo and MINEE annually and are dynamic in nature. Hence there is no clarity around where electrification will next take place and, in most cases, Eneo 'connects' properties that were fraudulently using electricity by installing electricity meters. Eneo loses about 20% of its production to fraud - around half of all consumption in the capital Yaoundé is fraudulent."
q38,CM,2,No,"Standards are currently being defined. It is likely the country will adopt international standards, as used by Eneo, which for distribution connections are based on the French model. At a transmission level, the standards used depend on the line in question. Given that some lines were built with funding from Spain, France and Canada among others, they used equipment from those countries and applied their standards accordingly. There are also standards at the CEMAC level, but these have not been applied as the markets are not connected."
q39,CM,1,Somewhat,"There are no formal restrictions, but also little awareness of the possibilities."
q41,CM,0,Yes,"Cameroon’s Rural Electrification Master Plan concerns the electrification of about 660 localities through the extension of interconnected grids, the rehabilitation and construction of isolated diesel power plants and mini-hydro plants, as well as the development of a regional grid. It is sponsored by the African Development Bank and the World Bank, among others."
q42,CM,0,Yes,"Agence d'Electrification Rurale du Cameroun (AER) is directly engaged in electrification projects and is attempting to catalyse the private sector, but has had no success in convincing private companies to take ownership stakes in any projects. It is being hindered by a lack of funds. The ministry is also engaged in solar electrification via a project that has set a target of 1,000 villages, starting with 166 in the pilot phase, compared with AER's target of 660."
q43,CM,2,Low,AER's budget is around XFA 20bn ($33.7m) for three years.
q44,CM,0,Yes,The 2016 Rural Electrification Master Plan has set a target of 98% by 2035.
q45,CM,0,Yes,The Rural Electrification Master Plan specifically targets the electrification of 50 villages through the development of mini-grids supplied by micro-hydro installations.
q46,CM,2,No,There are no funds in place to finance off-grid companies.
q47,CM,2,Low,"The cost of a new connection is $59.32, inclusive of VAT, but is higher if far from the nearest line. Officially, it takes five days from the day of request. Adding a meter to an existing connection costs about $30. Corruption is an issue - one ancedote describes how utility officials claimed the connection for a new-build area would require additional transformers at a cost of XFA 2m-3m ($3,000-$5,000) and expected bribes of around XFA 400,000 ($700) to make that requirement go away."
q48,CM,1,Somewhat,"AER finances connections 100%, but sometimes asks the population to contribute. For standard grid connections (for instance in urban areas) there are no subsidies."
q49,CM,1,Somewhat,"The Rural Energy Fund is supported by the World Bank, the EU and the state. However, it is currently in deficit owing to a lack of state funding and unable to make any further grants. In addition, the AER will fully fund off-grid developments and then hand them over to the local community to run and maintain."
q50,CM,0,Yes,"There is a VAT exemption on all solar equipment. This is the only form of 'subsidy' afforded to solar products in Cameroon. There is no import tariff waiver for solar products, but the government does allow for tariffs to be waived for specific projects, subject to negotiation. This is likely to apply to large projects involving foreign money and equipment, rather than small players."
q51,CM,2,No,A campaign run by the AER and UNIDO to raise awareness of renewables began in 2016. It is unclear whether this will relate specifically to off-grid technologies.
q53,CM,2,No,There are no specialist companies offering PAYG packages.
q54,CM,1,Somewhat,Any standards are effectively set by Eneo as it controls connection. National standards are under development with Eneo's guidance.
q55,CM,0,Yes,"The government's hydrocarbons prices stabilisation fund (CSPH) tightly regulates petrol, kerosene and diesel prices across the country, specifying the price charged in each locality based on distance from the nearest depot. It provides a monthly breakdown of fuel prices (the ""price structure""), and directly subsidises the domestic retail kerosene price to the tune of about 18% of the retail price (including tax). However, all domestic consumption petroleum fuels are bought centrally through the SCDP, which explains why total subsidies are around 44% for kerosene and 23% for diesel, according the Energy Ministry."
q56,CM,2,Low,There is a VAT exemption on all solar equipment. This is the only form of 'subsidy' afforded to solar products in Cameroon.
q57,CM,0,Yes,Cameroon has implemented a VAT exemption on all solar equipment. This is the only form of 'subsidy' afforded to solar products in Cameroon.
q58,CM,2,No,"There is no import tariff waiver for solar products, but the government does allow for tariffs to be waived for specific projects, subject to negotiation. This is likely to apply to large projects involving foreign money and equipment, rather than small players."
q59,CM,1,Somewhat,None
q60,CM,1,Somewhat,The main barrier mentioned by solar retailers is customer awareness.
q61,CM,2,Low,"PV modules: As part of the CEMAC trade zone, import duties are set for the trade region as a whole. Import duties range from 5% for primary goods, to 30% for consumption goods. Solar lanterns: Tariff for general portable lamp category. Batteries: Import duties are Lead-acid batteries only face a 10% import duty, while other battery types go up to 20% and 30%."
q23,CD,0,Yes,"Mining companies and private energy companies have long been allowed to operate mini-grids as part of bilateral agreements with the government. In addition, the 2014 electricity sector law liberalised the market and provides a framework for private sector participation."
q24,CD,1,Somewhat,"Mining companies and private companies have been allowed to operate specific grids, although the bulk of capacity is still operated by the national utility. And while the 2014 electricity sector law provides the legal framework for concessions, the absence of a regulator means that there is no clear process to obtain a concession."
q25,CD,0,Yes,"There is no upper limit. However, the 2014 electricity sector law only applies to generating assets of installed capacity of 50kW or more."
q26,CD,2,No,"A decree to establish an electricity regulator was signed in April 2016. The office is expected to be operational by mid-2017. In the meantime, the energy ministry is performing most regulatory tasks."
q27,CD,2,No,"SNEL (the national utility) is not set up to efficiently and effectively deal with requests from private project developers. As it dominates the country's electricity sector, it is looking to remain dominant rather than accommodate private developers."
q28,CD,2,No,"In the absence of an electricity regulator, the procedure to set up a mini-grid is cumbersome and non-transparent. However, the country's Investment Promotion Agency (ANAPI) can assist private investors, for instance by advocating on their behalf with the various government entities."
q29,CD,0,Yes,The experience of individual private companies shows that tariff levels make it possible to recover costs. Tariffs are determined via bilateral negotiations. A general tariff framework will likely be implemented by the (as yet non-existent) regulator.
q30,CD,1,Somewhat,"Tariff stability depends on the individual contracts agreed between developers and the government, on which there is little transparency."
q31,CD,1,Somewhat,"This depends on the individual contracts agreed between developers and the government, on which there is little transparency."
q32,CD,2,No,A standardised framework is likely to be implemented by the (as yet non-existent) regulator.
q33,CD,2,No,A standardised framework is likely to be implemented by the (as yet non-existent) regulator.
q34,CD,2,No,"As per decree n16/013, the regulator will ensure that private companies have access to the transmission grid (within the physical constraints of the grid). However, as the regulator does not yet exist, this is difficult to implement."
q35,CD,1,Somewhat,"This depends on the individual agreements between developers and the government. As per decree n16/013, the regulator, once established, will ensure clear norms and standards for connecting projects to the grid."
q36,CD,1,Somewhat,"This depends on the individual contracts agreed between developers and the government, on which there is little transparency. The vastness of the country means that, in many cases, there is little risk that an isolated grid will get connected to the main electricity grid."
q37,CD,2,No,There is no evidence of grid extension plans.
q38,CD,1,Somewhat,"This depends on the individual agreements between developers and the government. As per decree n16/013, the regulator, once established, will ensure clear norms and standards for connecting projects to the grid."
q39,CD,0,Yes,There are no rules preventing this. Private energy companies seem to opt mostly for a prepayment solution instead of offering financial services.
q41,CD,2,No,"There is no plan in place. Institutional responsibility for rural electrification has been fragmented, and little has been done. The 2014 electricity sector law provides for an agency that will promote and finance rural and peri-urban electrification. L'Agence Nationale des Services d'Electrification Rurale (ANSER) is being set up by an inter-ministerial committee with technical assistance from the European Union. A decree for the implementation of the agency has been drafted and approved, with full implementation expected by mid-2017. The agency will have to formulate an electrification plan."

q43,CD,2,Low,There is no specific budget for rural electrification. Programmes are scattered between multiple foreign donors and multilateral institutions such as the African Development Bank and World Bank.
q44,CD,0,Yes,"The country’s electrification rate is low at 9.6%. The government’s vision is to increase the level of service to 32% by 2030. In the context of an energy access forum in 2015, the Energy Ministry stated that by end of 2016 the country could reach an electrification rate of 18% thanks to the completion of several hydro projects, however this seems overly optimistic."
q45,CD,2,No,"There are no off-grid or mini-grid plans in place yet. An agency to promote and finance rural and peri-urban electrification, ANSER, is being set up by an inter-ministerial committee with technical assistance from the European Union. A decree for the implementation of the agency has been drafted and approved, with full implementation expected by mid-2017."
q46,CD,2,No,There is no evidence of this.
q47,CD,1,Average,"This is the estimated cost per customer of connecting 225,000 customers around the urban area of Kinshasa, which is budgeted at a total of $127m. With an electrification rate of only 9%, the vast majority of the population lives in an area that is far removed from the nearest grid connection. Therefore, the average cost to connect the entire population would be significantly higher."
q48,CD,1,Somewhat,"There is no comprehensive programme to promote grid connection through subsidies. However, ad hoc electrification programmes, generally related to generation projects such as the Inga hydro scheme, incorporate a rural electrification component with an implied investment subsidy."
q49,CD,2,No,"There are no grants or other incentives, other than exemption from import duties."
q50,CD,2,No,"There are no VAT reductions. Generally, importers and distributors of products such as solar lamps, panels and so on must pay a 10% import tax. However, it is likely that the government will extend decree n15/009 to off-grid solar products, which would exempt these products from import duties and any VAT levied at time of import. It is unclear when this would be implemented."
q51,CD,0,Yes,"Elan RDC, a project financed by the British government, is seeking to develop the private sector in the country. It has been helping off-grid solar companies sell their solutions."
q53,CD,1,Somewhat,A market-wide PAYG platform does not exist yet. Electricite de Congo (EDC) has a proprietary platform that works with a prepayment meter that can be charged with a code that is purchased at an EDC shop. 
q54,CD,2,No,There is no evidence of standards.
q55,CD,2,No,IMF data shows that DRC phased out all subsidies for petroleum products between 2013 and 2015.

q60,CD,1,Somewhat,
q61,CD,2,Low,"Based on discussions with Elan RDC, it is estimated there is a 10% duty on all renewable equipment. (Elan RDC is an Adam Smith International/ UK Department for International Development initiative.)"
q23,CI,1,Somewhat,"The installation of power generation facilities on private property has always been possible in Cote d’Ivoire leading to a number of relatively large projects, notably those linked to agricultural activities. However, it is forbidden to build grids and sell electricity without a license under the 2014 Electricity Act, regardless of the size or location of the project. The act also opens the door to self-consumers selling excess electricity to the grid. Such licenses will be awarded on a case-by-case basis and stipulate a regulated tariff, suggesting that the opportunity will be limited to larger loads. CIE holds a contract granting it monopoly rights over the distribution and retail of electricity until 2020. Thereafter, the government may decide to award licenses that are limited in time and geography to new private actors. At least one off-grid electricity company has decided to sell power services linked to its off-grid clean energy generation installations (for instance, mobile phone charging, tv and refrigeration), which is possible under Ivoirian law. The requirement to have a banking license to engage in leasing activities is a further hurdle to the development of off-grid electrification, which often needs some form of financing plan to increase uptake. "
q24,CI,2,No,"The launch of an ambitious electrification programme in 2014 and enactment of the Electricity Act the same year, establishes grid extension as the main government priority. Consequently, it has been reluctant to establish a regulatory framework specifically for mini-grids. From 2020, when the CIE monopoly over distribution and retail ends, the 2014 Electricity Act provides a very loose framework that could, in theory, lead to the awarding of off-grid concessions. Today, however, there is little intention to support off-grid electrification (given the difficulties that community-owned projects currently experience with the regulatory authorities). The period to 2020 and how the Electricity Act is implemented will be critical in defining whether or not Cote d’Ivoire opens up to mini-grid and renewable energy developers. As the number of connectable places (those that are either of sufficient size or close enough to the grid) dimishes, the government may see that awarding off-grid concessions is a financially attractive alternative to grid expansion."
q25,CI,0,Yes,"There is no threshold limiting the size of a mini-grid or generation project on private property. However, retail of electricity is not authorised until 2020, when CIE's monopoly runs out, and after that date a license will be required. The 2014 Electricity Act permits self-consumption projects to sell excess power to the grid, however this would also require a license. Current government thinking suggests that this will be limited to larger projects. Nonetheless, the prospect of higher retail power prices and increasing strain on the system as new demand centres are connected recommends the installation of additional generation facilities that will reduce utility bills and ensure system reliability. "
q26,CI,2,No,Assessment of projects is done on a case-by-case basis by the different regulatory and executive organisations of the sector. 
q27,CI,2,No,There is no dedicated team at the utility to deal with developers' requirements.

"
q30,CI,0,Yes,"PPAs are drafted on a “take-or-pay” basis and prices are negotiated to guarantee a profit margin. These agreements include all fuel supplies, meaning that developers are warrantied a stable profit margin. However, the government is looking to exclude fuel supply from future contracts in an attempt to increase the efficiency of the sector."
q31,CI,2,No,"Tariffs for IPPs are determined on a case-by-case basis. They are set in long-term 'take-or-pay' contracts that guarantee a profit margin. There is no evidence of innovative price structures that would recognise the needs of alternative business models, such as capacity payments for renewables. The current framework does not allow for the setting up of mini-grids or small power projects selling directly to consumers so actors are exploring selling energy-related services for which regulation is less constraining.  "
q32,CI,2,No,Assessment of projects is done on a case-by-case basis by the different regulatory and executive organisations of the sector. 
q33,CI,0,Yes,"PPAs are drafted on a “take-or-pay” basis and prices are negotiated to guarantee a profit margin.

However, the government is looking to exclude fuel supply from future contracts in an attempt to increase the efficiency of the sector."
q34,CI,0,Yes,All IPPs operate under negotiated take-or-pay contracts. The 2014 Electricity Act obliges the off-taker to take all IPP output.
q35,CI,2,No,"There are no clearly defined processes and standards for connecting projects to the grid as these are drafted on a case-by-case basis. The 2014 Electricity Act will address this in two ways - first, PPAs signed with IPPs or self-consumers are to be approved by the regulator and made public to serve as a blueprint for other contracts and, secondly, liberalisation of the transmission, distribution segment and, to a lesser extent, dispatching, is to be paired with stricter regulation and definition of processes and standards for the sector. "
q36,CI,2,No,"Mini-grids are not allowed until CIE's monopoly runs in 2020.  While the 2014 Electricity Act could open up a number of opportunities for small grid developers or renewable energy, at present it looks unlikely that the government will back such enterprises. "
q37,CI,1,Somewhat,"An up-to-date map of planned transmission lines can be obtained from the regulator's website. It is unclear how much detail regarding transmission and distribution plans is available. The draft energy sector master plan sets out details of full electrification by 2025, but it is not publicly available."
q38,CI,1,Somewhat,"General grid injection standards are set by the 2014 Electricity Act. More detailed rules will be introduced the country's regulator, the Anare, when it is awarded greater responsibilities. Cote d'Ivoire also has a number of certification agencies and regulations that have a direct impact on small power producers. Codinorm, the country's standards agency, for instance, sets standards for most components of small renewable energy power plants."
q39,CI,2,No,"Power producers may only sell their output to a distributor. CIE is the sole off-taker until at least 2020, when its monopoly officially runs out. Companies that have been providing energy-related services in rural areas have not been offering financial services such as leasing to consumers as they would need to have a banking licence, which is not easy to obtain.     "
q41,CI,0,Yes,"Cote d’Ivoire launched its Electricity for All programme in October 2014. It aims to electrify all population centres, or just under 1m households by 2020, and will prioritise settlements of more than 500 inhabitants. The grid extensions are being financed by the government and carried out by CIE. The programme also finances connection costs, charging XOF 1,000 (just under $2) up front instead of the usual XOF 150,000 (around $250), which it recuperates over 10 years. The meters installed by CIE are all pre-pay and range between 5W and 15W, with tariffs ranging from XOF 88/kWh (around $0.15/kWh) for consumption of less than 100kWh per month, to XOF 301/kWh ($0.52/kWh). The objective of the programme is also to tackle electricity theft, the penalties for which increased considerably under the 2014 Electricity Act.  
qThe programme reportedly connected 20,000 households between October 2014 and November 2015, and a further 70,000 by April 2016, signifying an acceleration in uptake. Despite this trend, the country is unlikely to reach its objective of full electrification by 2020 as the number of large and accessible population centres diminishes, leaving smaller, harder to reach towns and villages. "
q42,CI,1,Somewhat,"Cote d'Ivoire does not have a dedicated rural electrification agency, but CIE is the operational agency responsible for all matters related to the government's electricity strategy, including the rural electrification programme."
q43,CI,1,Average,"Cote d'Ivoire's electrification programme is estimated to cost around XOF 475bn (or $796m under the 2015 exchange rate) between 2015 and 2020. The final cost projections will be approved in 2016 as part of the rural electrification plan. Around XOF 21.8bn (or $36.6m) of this is to be spent on off-grid electrification by 2020, and around half of this figure is expected to go to solar systems. The programme has identified 28 localities of less than 250 inhabitants that live more than 18km from the grid."
q44,CI,0,Yes,"The government aims to fully electrify the country and connect one million homes by 2020. The programme reportedly connected 20,000 households between October 2014 and November 2015, and 70,000 by April 2016. Despite this trend, the country is unlikely to reach its objective of full electrification by 2020 as the number of large and accessible population centres diminishes, leaving smaller, harder to reach towns and villages. A new electrification strategy with an estimated budget of XOF 475bn (or $796m under the 2015 exchange rate) to 2020 is being drafted. This could push back the full electrification target to a more realistic 2025 and aims to have 50% of the country’s homes connected by 2020, and between 70% and 90% by 2035. "
q45,CI,1,Somewhat,The programme has identified 28 localities of less than 250 inhabitants that live more than 18km from the grid.
q46,CI,2,No,There are no funds in place to finance off-grid companies.
q47,CI,2,Low,"The price of connecting a household to the grid in an electrified area is normally set at XOF 150,000 or around $250. However, under the current electrification programme, the connection cost is subsidised and paid over 10 years through electricity bills. This has reduced the upfront connection and installation cost of a prepaid meter to less than $2."

This has reduced the upfront connection and installation cost of a prepaid meter to less than $2."
q49,CI,1,Somewhat,"There is no evidence that government agencies or commercial finance providers support off-grid initiatives. However, a number of organisations such the telecoms company Orange and Energy Globe have awarded prizes to off-grid renewables companies in recent years, raising the profile of these solutions in the country.  "
q50,CI,0,Yes,"Solar PV products generally benefit from a reduced VAT rate - 9% against the normal 18% applied to most goods and services - and a reduced import duty of nil to 1%. However, securing such discounts is cumbersome, from both customs (for the duty exemption) and from the Ministry of Finance for the VAT reduction. Delays at customs can be costly as importers need to pay for warehouse space in the harbour. These problems have led to considerable contraband imports from neighbouring Burkina Faso, where exemptions cover a wider set of components and are easier to access."
q51,CI,2,No,"Cote d’Ivoire’s active electrification programme and the draft of the upcoming electrification strategy are clear indicators that the government will focus on electrification through the main grid. This, combined with legislation that does not permit off-grid electricity retailing, explains the lack of market-building programmes and activity. "
q53,CI,0,Yes,"Cote d’Ivoire has a vibrant mobile money sector. MTN Mobile Money and Orange Money, both subsidiaries of the country’s main telecoms companies, offer integration of their mobile money platforms with third-party businesses. A number of smaller players are also active in the sector. Mobile money is used by off-grid renewables businesses to receive payments from vendors in rural areas that have a stock of products. However, pay-as-you-go systems are not in use as this would require the retailer to have a banking licence."
q54,CI,2,No,"There are no standards targeting pico-solar specifically, although Cote d’Ivoire has a certification agency that covers a number of individual electronic components. In general, there is very little control over the quality of the products imported, and the use of makeshift and dangerous power systems in rural areas is common. "
q55,CI,2,No,"While diesel prices are regulated and harmonised across the country, they are broadly reflective of cost and are updated several times per year. Delivery in remote areas is more expensive owing to transport costs."

q60,CI,0,Yes,"Most off-grid renewable power companies acknowledge there is still a lack of trust and awareness about their offering. The decades-long political messaging around Cote d’Ivoire as a major electricity hub in the region has created high expectations amongst would be customers. The communication around the current electrification programme, which aims for full electrification by 2020, has further contributed to these expectations. Logistics and infrastructure in general are another challenge, as poor access to rural areas leads to delays in delivery and increased costs for maintenance of remote installations. Finally, technical capacity is also lacking and installations are often used in ways not foreseen by their manufacturer, for example, by connecting too many products to the power storage system, thereby rapidly reducing the capacity of the battery."
q61,CI,2,Low,There is a 15% import duty on spare parts for solar lanterns. 
q23,ET,0,Yes,"Developers can set up IPPs and build mini-grids after receiving investment permits and operating licenses from the regulator, the Ethiopian Energy Authority (EEA), but none have done so. There are no official (grid-connected) mini-grids in Ethiopia, even though there are many unofficial off-grid diesel (and solar) generators that serve citizens in remote locations.  "
q24,ET,1,Somewhat,The government’s strategy for electrification is i) connect villages to the national electric grid; and ii) allow unofficial off-grid diesel and solar generators to emerge organically and without government intervention.
q25,ET,0,Yes,There is no mention of a threshold in the various energy proclamations.
q26,ET,1,Somewhat,"The EEA is charged with the issuing of licenses for generation, transmission and distribution. For grid-connected generation projects the EEA only reviews the tariff application before submitting it to government for final approval. "
q27,ET,1,Somewhat,"Apart from the EEA (which deals with regulatory approval), the Ministry of Water Irrigation and Electricity (specifically the Energy Study and Development division) is a resource for actors in the Ethiopian electricity sector. They maintain energy data, forecasts and action plans that can be helpful for developers."
q28,ET,2,No,"There is no standard documentation for small power projects, although the EEA is currently establishing technological specifications and PPA guidelines for IPPs."
q29,ET,2,No,"Low, subsidised electricity tariffs are the primary reason that grid-scale investment in the Ethiopian electricity industry has not extended much beyond state-sponsored activity. Off-grid, there are no tariffs to consider. Here, the ‘free market’ determines the value of backup generation (behind the meter) and off-grid energy access where there is no transmission system (approximately half the country). "
q30,ET,1,Somewhat,"There are no examples of private enterprises earning on-grid tariffs. Retail rates have been kept artificially low and stable for many years, and are likely to remain so for the next few years, but eventually a rise is inevitable. Off-grid ‘tariffs’ can be structured in bilateral negotiations that are neither regulated nor known by the regulators nor utilities. "
q31,ET,1,Somewhat,"Retail rates have been kept artificially low and stable for many years, and are likely to remain so for the next few years, but eventually a rise is inevitable."
q32,ET,2,No,"The criteria for assessing PPAs is still under review by the EEA, even though IPPs have technically been permitted for over a decade. With so few projects to consider, it is likely that PPAs will continue to be drafted on a case-by-case basis."
q33,ET,1,Somewhat,"Generation licenses have a maximum duration depending on technology. The longest is 40 years for hydro projects and the shortest is 15 years for diesel generation. With so few examples of on-grid PPAs signed with the state generation utility (EEP, formerly EEPCo), it is inappropriate to generalise about PPA duration. What is more relevant is the fact that the economics (price) simply does not facilitate the genesis of ‘bankable’ projects."
q34,ET,2,No,"This is determined on a case-by-case basis and is decided when the terms of the PPA are being negotiated. The only known example of a PPA is Reykjavik Geothermal's agreement with EEP. It covers 500MW of output, even though Phase I of the project will be only 20MW. The full potential (including later phases) could grow to 1GW."
q35,ET,1,Somewhat,Third parties can get access to the grid provided the connection will not impede the owner's operations and they pay a tariff to be determined by the regulator. 
q36,ET,1,Somewhat,"Proclamation 317/2003, which established the Rural Electrification Fund, states that the operator of a rural electrification programme will be fairly compensated when the grid arrives. There is no indication as to what the government believes is ‘adequate’ compensation."
q37,ET,0,Yes,"Ethiopia's Growth and Transformation Plans (GTP I and GTP II) clearly state EEP's targets for grid expansion. By 2020, the GTP II target is to expand the area that has access to the grid from 50% to 90%. This will involve construction of an additional 11,000km of high-voltage transmission lines, nearly double the 2015 total of 14,000km."
q38,ET,0,Yes,Mini-grid operators must follow the same safety standards and conditions as on-grid operators.
q39,ET,2,No,"Officially, no. EEU is the sole retailer of electricity in Ethiopia. Unofficially, however, through behind-the-meter back-up diesel generators, the answer is 'yes'. Bilateral contracts take many forms, including those that would qualify as financial services."

q42,ET,0,Yes,"The Rural Electrification Executive Secretariat is charged with running the Rural Electrification Fund's projects and falls under the Alternative Energy Development and Promotion Directorate at the Ministry of Water and Energy. The regulatory setup is complex, with overlapping authority and inconsistent policies. The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) counted six agencies involved in rural electrification."
q43,ET,0,High,$100m is committed by the federal government per year. An additional $30m or so of private (non-governmental) capital is committed yearly to increasing electricity access. It is not known exactly how much is ear-marked specifically for off-grid projects.
q44,ET,0,Yes,"Ethiopia's first Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP I) for 2010-15 sought to double the number of people with access to electricity, from 2m to 4m. "
q45,ET,0,Yes,"The second (current) Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP II) seeks to boost market penetration of off-grid solar technology. It set a target to distribute 3.6m solar lanterns and 400,000 solar home systems by 2020, up from an estimated 1m solar lanterns and 150,000 solar home systems in 2015. "

q55,ET,0,Yes,"The Ministry of Trade sets the price for benzene, diesel, kerosene and natural gas to provide stability – more than affordability – for Ethiopian consumers. For example, the Ministry maintains a fund that it uses to either subsidise or tax fuel during commodity price upswings or downswings. Even if this process offers a net-zero subsidy, fuels benefit from indirect subsidies owing to the fact that they are VAT-exempt."
q56,ET,1,Medium,The VAT rate on off-grid solar products is 15%.
q57,ET,0,Yes,Renewable energy products can receive exemption from import duty.
q58,ET,0,Yes,Import duties for solar lanterns is set at 0%.
q59,ET,0,Yes,Access to foreign exchange is limited. This puts importers on a waiting list when trying to purchase goods in a foreign currency. Solar importers have complained of this issue.
q60,ET,0,Yes,"Economics will continue to be a challenge for off-grid solar, which is marketed to an impoverished customer base. Access to finance is extremely rare among rural communities, and presents a significant challenge. Market awareness is poor. Many Ethiopians simply do not know about the benefits of solar lanterns. There are efforts underway to improve this issue. For example, in September 2015, Lighting Africa launched a $20m consumer campaign aimed at educating consumers about the benefits of solar lighting and about the products available. "
q61,ET,2,Low,There is a zero rate import duty on ‘lanterns operating by renewable energy sources’.
q23,GH,0,Yes,"Small power producers can apply for electricity supply licenses, as the facility exists for embedded generation (otherwise known as distributed generation, whereby generation is connected to the distribution network rather than the transmission network). There is a 30MW coal-fired power plant under development that will supply a gold mine. In November 2015, the government released an International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) assessment of renewable energy in the country. The World Bank's Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) released a study that includes analysis on policy development, business models, financial models and tariffs."
q24,GH,1,Somewhat,"The regulator, the Energy Commission (EC), is authorised to delineate the area to be covered by a distribution license, which grants the licensee exclusive rights to the area. This will apply, by extension, to mini-grids. Under a concession, there is no requirement for the government to own the assets, although traditionally the assets have been government-owned. There is at least one investor-owned distribution entity (Enclave Power Company), which has procured and installed, and now owns and operates an area network under license issued by the EC."
q25,GH,1,Somewhat,"Very small mini-grids, those of less than 100kW, are exempt from all regulation. Large projects and mini-grid require formal licensing."
q26,GH,2,No,"The EC is the technical regulator, and the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) is responsible for economic regulation."
q27,GH,2,No,"Developers seeking to connect to the grid deal with GridCo's market operations and grid consultancy teams, while offtake agreements need to be agreed with individual offtakers."
q28,GH,0,Yes,Project developers would like to see more structure and a template-like approach when finalising agreements.
q29,GH,2,No,"The government's objective is to ensure that electricity pricing is efficient and competitive, while providing rates that are affordable. PURC has set guidelines that developers need to adhere to, and it will make a final decision based on each application. In 2015, however, tariffs were increased by 59% and therefore probably did not follow the procedure and consultation as stipulated. With regard to mini-grids, there have only been four pilot projects so far and these have all been government-led. Would-be project developers are wary of 10-year PPAs, stating that 10 years is not long enough and that they do not trust the government to honour the agreements. The government is considering extending it to 20 years. Given that Ghana is under immense economic strain (due to low commodity prices) and that there is a national election in November, the state has found it difficult to pay generators for electricity. "
q30,GH,1,Somewhat,"As there is no standardised PPA for mini-grids and as contracts are dependent on the discretion of the government, it is unknown whether these tariffs will remain stable over time. "
q31,GH,1,Somewhat,"As there is no standardised PPA for mini-grids, contracts are dependent on the discretion of the government. "
q32,GH,2,No,There is no standardised PPA for mini-grids. Contracts are therefore dependent on the discretion of the government. 
q33,GH,2,No,Developers have asked for the current 10-year on-grid PPA to be extended to 20 years. The government is reviewing this and is in the process of implementing structures to formulate a 20-year PPA. This is unlikely to be announced until after the December 2016 elections.

q45,GH,1,Somewhat, The 2010 National Energy Policy and the National Electrification Scheme (NES) and Self-Help Electrification Programme (SHEP) state that off-grid projects and mini-grids are options to be considered.
q46,GH,0,Yes,"Rural electrification in Ghana received $98m from the Industrial Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Standard Chartered Bank Ghana.  Some 556 communities will benefit from this project. Under NES and SHEP more than 5,000 communities have been connected to the national grid. The World Bank, through its GEDAP initiative has committed $90m. This will be used to improve the efficiency of the rural electricity distribution. "
q47,GH,0,High,"The figure will be dependent on the pre-existing grid infrastructure and location. In the North, there is a greater demand for communities to be electrified by off-grid technology and here costs are higher at $2,397 per household. Communities in the south have better access to the existing grid and thus have lower costs of connection. "
q48,GH,1,Somewhat,The 'lifeline tariff' is a subsidised connection that helps low-income families with their first connection.

q23,HT,0,Yes,"According to The Haiti Sustainable Energy Roadmap ""mini-grid development already exists in Haiti. Largely because EDH has been able to extend grid access by only 10% over the past several decades, dozens of organizations have begun building minigrids throughout the country. EDH has assisted in the development of 28 diesel-based mini-grids for towns throughout the country, but these face chronic funding shortages and are now largely non-operational. An ongoing project seeks to combine several of these grids into an integrated system."" Additionally, Earth Spark has set up a mini-grid in Les Anglais. ""It initially started with 14 customers but has now grown to over 400 customers. The grid uses custom-made smart-meter technology to enable a business model of pre-paid energy."" The success and momentum behind this project highlight the potential for minigrids and smart-meter technology in Haiti."" Also, the NRECCA's Haiti Rural Electric Cooperative Project is transforming ""several mini-grids in three communes of the Département Sud in the southwest of Haiti into a new, formally registered rural electric cooperative that will provide reliable electric service seven days a week within a sustainable financial model, and demonstrate the feasibility of a clean energy investment in solar-diesel hybrid generation for isolated rural mini-grids. ""Also, given that only three of Haiti’s sub-national grids have an operational capacity above 10MW, most of the current system could already be classified as mini-grids."""
q24,HT,2,No,"The first concession is expected to be established soon. In June 2014, the government opened a process to select a private company to take EDH's role in the Southeast department. The winning company will be awarded a concession for generation, transmission, distribution and sales of electricity in the department. As of June 2016, no updates had been published."
q25,HT,0,Yes,There is no legislation regarding the size of mini-grids or small generation projects in Haiti. 
q26,HT,2,No,There is no lead actor for regulatory approval.
q27,HT,2,No,"Currently, the Minister Delegate to the Prime Minister for Energy Security is the only one responsible for energy matters in Haiti. According to Haiti Sustainable Energy Roadmap, ""in Haiti, there is no designated institution—either inside or outside a ministry—dedicated to energy sector regulation. Instead, the duties of a regulator are either shared by various institutions, or simply not performed. In January 2013, the World Bank highlighted Haiti’s lack of an energy regulatory framework as a key barrier to advancement. Without there oversight of a regulatory body, EDH has essentially acted as its own regulator, making most decisions unilaterally about the right to operate on the grid, the terms and conditions of operation, tariff rates and investment opportunities. "
q28,HT,2,No,There is no regulatory procedure at all.

It aims to start a new electric cooperative in South Haiti, alongside clean energy investments by the United Nations Environment Programme. The Haiti Rural Electric Cooperative Project intends to transform several mini-grids in three communes of southwest Haiti – Port-a-Piment, Coteaux, and Roche à Bateaux – into a new, formally registered rural electric cooperative that will provide reliable electricity service 7 days a week within a sustainable financial model. It will also demonstrate the feasibility of clean energy investment in solar-diesel hybrid generation for isolated rural mini-grids.
qNRECA’s partner in the project is the Solar Electric Light Fund (SELF), a non-profit organization specialized in solar generation, which is handling the design and installation of the rooftop solar installations, installing solar-powered streetlights, and training cooperative personnel in operating and maintaining the solar power installations. As of June 2015, there were more than 600 cooperative members, who have conducted their first general assembly and elected the Board of Directors. The HREC project sponsors are the Government of Norway, UNEP, the Inter-American Development Bank, USAID, and the NRECA International Foundation.""

q42,HT,2,No,"Currently there isn't a rural electrification agency in Haiti. According to the World Watch Institute ""to address Haiti’s extremely low electrification rate, the government should create a Rural Electrification Agency dedicated specifically to rural energy issues. This office could help relieve EDH’s regulatory burden and monitor quality of service in specific areas, making rural electrification programs and businesses profitable in the long term.

q23,KE,0,Yes,"The regulatory framework allows for private entities to apply for a power distribution licence.  To date, this has been used by PowerHive, which plans to build and operate 100 mini-grids in partnership with Italy-based utility Enel. There are other small mini-grid operators that work without formal regulatory approval. Regulations for self-consumption of power are very light-handed."
q24,KE,1,Somewhat,"PowerHive has a power distribution license. However, this does not grant the company exclusive rights over specific areas."
q25,KE,0,Yes,"Under the 2015 Energy Bill, a licence is required for any generation capacity. Self-consumption under 1MW does not require a license."
q26,KE,2,No,Project developers have to deal with a variety of agencies. The Energy Regulatory Commission maintains a website that outlines the licensing process and provides relevant documentation. http://www.renewableenergy.go.ke/index.php/search/licensesearch.
q27,KE,2,No,There is no dedicated team.
q28,KE,0,Yes,The regulatory framework requires no licensing for self-consumption projects under 1MW. Retailing power from a mini-grid requires a distribution license as well as agreement on a tariff.
q29,KE,1,Somewhat,Mini-grid developers that obtained a distribution license would have to comply with the regulated tariff structure for grid power. Any deviation from this needs to be negotiated with the government and regulator.
q30,KE,0,Yes,Regulated on-grid tariffs are reviewed regularly. A feed-in tariff lasts for 20 years and is set in nominal terms with only a partial escalator. It is therefore likely to decline in real terms.
q31,KE,1,Somewhat,The current regulation requires independent power distributors to adhere to the regulated retail tariff. PowerHive is likely to establish a precedent should the regulator agree differential tariffs for mini-grids.
q32,KE,1,Somewhat,The Energy Regulatory Commission provides a power purchase agreement (PPA) template on its website. Developers say that some of the template terms are not bankable and require renegotiation. 
q33,KE,0,Yes,The PPA terms are 20 years.
q34,KE,1,Somewhat,The PPA template states that the buyer will purchase the net electrical output as ascertained by the metering equipment. The PPA template also contains a clause allowing the buyer to interrupt or reduce offtake under certain conditions. Developers report that these terms are not bankable and have been amended for some projects.
q35,KE,0,Yes,"The PPA template states that the seller must, at its own expense, design, purchase, construct, operate and maintain the interconnection facility."
q36,KE,2,No,"The PPA template states that the seller must, at its own expense, design, purchase, construct, operate and maintain the interconnection facility."
q37,KE,1,Somewhat,Plans are reportedly being made available to interested parties as they are developed.

Most battery technologies commonly used for mini-grids or other distributed energy systems, including lead-acid and nickel-cadmium, are subject to a 25% import tariff under the East African Community customs union."
q23,LR,2,No,"More than 90% of Liberia's generation comes from illegal IPPs that run small diesel generators and sell electricity to their neighbours. Mini-grids or small power projects for self use would need to go through special approval processes with the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy and eventually the energy regulator when it is established. Hotels, restaurants and households utilise small diesel generators for electricity, but this does not constitute a mini-grid or small power project."
q24,LR,2,No,"No specific areas have been set aside for mini-grid developers. However, the Rural Renewable Energy Agency (RREA) is actively evaluating potential sites for mini-grids to be developed throughout the country. Thus far, over 700 locations have been studied by RREA as potential mini-hydro sites, with nine locations chosen as ""priority"" due to lower levelised costs of electricity (LCOE) than solar/diesel based mini-grids. RREA is working with the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) to perform studies on potential solar mini-grid locations."
q25,LR,0,Yes,"There is no limit to the size of a mini-grid. The largest off-grid generation project is Firestone's 4MW mini-hydro project, while the smallest is a 24kW distributed solar project in Nimba county. No official legislation has been established relating to mini-grid size, as this is still a relatively young market in Liberia."
q26,LR,1,Somewhat,"An independent energy regulator has not been established, although one is expected by October 2017. Currently, the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy is acting as the sole regulator in the country. The lack of an independent regulator means there are no standardised PPAs, and that there is no enforcement of tariffs."
q27,LR,2,No,"No IPPs have developed generation projects in Liberia, and LEC has no dedicated team to facilitate developers' needs."
q28,LR,2,No,No regulatory framework has been established for setting up mini-grids.
q29,LR,1,Somewhat,"LEC sells electricity at $0.52/kWh to recover costs from transmission and distribution losses, which are among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Due to expensive diesel costs, the utility operates at a loss. It is uncertain whether an IPP would be able to recover its costs. The lack of an independent energy regulator to enforce tariffs and structure PPAs at optimal prices is another factor that makes it prohibitive for an IPP to develop in Liberia at the moment."
q30,LR,0,Yes,Liberia's $0.52/kWh electricity tariff is applied consistently throughout the entire country. The tariff is revised downwards when a new source of electricity is connected to the grid. Illegal off-grid IPPs also charge a flat monthly rate to all customers. Tariff switches are far from dynamic owing to the absence of a wholesale power market and the presence only one distributor.
q31,LR,2,No,The lack of an independent energy regulator in the short-term and absence of IPPs makes any tariff deregulation unrealistic in the near term. Power producers cannot structure tariffs to align them with their business model.
q32,LR,2,No,"LEC owns all generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, so no standardised PPA or duration has been established. Once an independent regulator is established and IPPs enter the generation market, PPA pricing and duration will be standardised."
q33,LR,2,No,"Once an independent regulator is established and IPPs enter the generation market, PPA pricing and duration will be standardised."
q34,LR,2,No,"LEC is under no obligation to take all of the output from a project, especially in the absence of an independent energy regulator to enforce PPAs. The utility's ability meet the requirements of a PPA will depend on its financial stability, which is tied in to its ability to finance and construct transmission lines to deliver electricity generated from grid-connected projects to a substation."
q35,LR,2,No,"No such rules exist, and there is no energy regulator to enforce anything at present. "
q36,LR,2,No,The RREA is developing mini-grids in cooperation with LEC to meet the country's electrification goals. These projects are being developed in remote areas that are a long way from reliable grid-supplied electricity. No rules have been established for the arrival of the main grid.
q37,LR,0,Yes,Liberia's Rural Electrification Plan is easy to obtain. It is a 120-page document outlining plans to provide electricity to Liberians outside of Monrovia in rural communities.
q38,LR,2,No,"No such standards exist, and no small power producers have entered the country yet."
q39,LR,2,No,"The only power producer in Liberia is LEC, and it does not offer financial services to customers."
q41,LR,0,Yes,"The Rural Renewable Energy Agency (RREA) is developing off-grid renewable power projects in rural areas. Operational projects include a 1MW mini-hydro project in Bong County, a 60kW small hydro mini-grid, two biomass plants totalling 96kW and a 24kW solar mini-grid in Lofa County. The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) is working with RREA to develop further renewable projects in rural areas, and conducting willingness-to-pay studies to determine priority communities for future instalments. The country has set a target of 35% rural electrification and 70% in Monrovia by 2030, which RREA will play a major role in achieving."
q42,LR,0,Yes,"RREA was established in January 2010. Its role is to facilitate and accelerate the economic transformation of rural Liberia by developing renewable energy projects and mini-grids outside of the capital, with help from NRECA."
q43,LR,0,High,"RREA's budget is $178.5m, broken into two phases of $121m and $57.5m. However, extension of the main grid is not part of its remit. LEC is responsible for grid extension, and operates as a different organisation."
q44,LR,0,Yes,"The government has set a 70% target for Greater Monrovia, and 35% nationwide by 2030."
q45,LR,0,Yes,Off-grid and mini-grid systems are considered necessary complements to centralised generation and transmission facilities in order to meet the 35% nationwide energy access target. RREA's main objective is to install mini-grids in communities outside of Monrovia and to promote the installation of off-grid solar.
q46,LR,0,Yes,"Through the Rural Electrification Fund (REFUND) facility, there is financing for mini-grid projects and stand-alone solar systems for households. The government of Liberia expects the REFUND facility to finance nine mini-grid projects and nine off-grid solar facilities, providing power to approximately 360,000 people. The African Development Bank and World Bank are providing financing to develop mini-grids and support the country's ongoing Scaling Up Renewable Energy Programme."

q23,MW,0,Yes,"The hydropower project at Bondo on Mount Mulanje is the only example of a functional micro-grid with a license for both generation and transmission. However, regulation is not standardised and the licensing procedure is considered tedious."
q24,MW,1,Somewhat,There is no specific legislative provision for mini-grids or for geographical concessions. The government decides on development of mini-grid projects on a case-by-case basis.
q25,MW,0,Yes,"As there is no specific legislative provision for mini-grids, no threshold has been set. However, the feed-in tariff (not yet in force) has a limit of 10MW. "
q26,MW,1,Somewhat,The lead actor is the Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority (MERA).
q27,MW,2,No,"ESCOM does not have a dedicated team/department that leads on the requirements for project developers. However, the utility was involved in setting tariffs for the Bondo project"
q28,MW,2,No,"There is no specific regulatory procedure for mini-grids. In the case of the Mulanje/Bondo mini-grid (the only one currently operating), MERA applies the 'grid code' used for the national utility, which appears to be unsustainable for the project's ongoing operations and maintenance (O&M)."
q29,MW,1,Somewhat,"Originally the tariff for the Mulanje/Bondo mini-grid project was set at $0.16/kWh, as opposed to $0.09/kWh at the national level, which was high enough for the developers to recover the costs of O&M (the majority of the equipment was provided by donors). Since then, the tariff has been reduced, first to $0.12/kWh and then $0.09/kWh. Mulanje Electricity Generation Authority (MEGA) and MERA are in talks to bring it back up to $0.12/kWh."
q30,MW,1,Somewhat,"The tariffs should remain stable over time. In the case of the Bondo mini-grid, the tariffs were adjusted according to the currency exchange rate. For the six wind mini-grids installed between 2007-2009 (at Mzimba and Nkhata-Bay in the north, Nkhota-Kota and Ntcheu in the central region and Chiradzulu and Thyolo in the south) tariff collections have not been regular. As a result, there was insufficient revenue to pay for major repairs or new batteries, and all projects subsequently failed. While the choice of technology was considered appropriate, the management, revenue and financial model as well as the service arrangements resulted in system failures."
q31,MW,1,Somewhat,"Tariffs are likely to be agreed at an individual project level for the foreseeable future, which allows for alignment with the developer's business model, within reason."
q32,MW,1,Somewhat,"A standard PPA was gazetted in April 2014, although it does not specify tariff levels or contract duration."
q33,MW,1,Somewhat,"Clause 2.2 of the standard PPA does not specify the duration of the agreement, but instead leaves it to the seller and the off-taker to agree. "
q34,MW,2,No,"The standardised PPA does not include a take-or-pay clause, nor does any regulation guarantee this for developers."
q35,MW,0,Yes,A grid code has been approved with rules on the process and standards for connecting to the grid.
q36,MW,2,No,There are no specific rules for mini-grids connecting to the main grid as there is no precedent.
q37,MW,2,No,There is lack of clarity about how and where the plans can be accessed. 
q38,MW,1,Somewhat,"Yes, according to the grid code, small power producers need to adhere to specific standards. However, there is no clarity on how/if they have ever been implemented."
q39,MW,2,No,"Small-scale off-grid solar producers offer certain financial services to their local customers, but there are no examples of utility-scale IPPs doing the same."
q41,MW,0,Yes,The Malawi Rural Electrification Programme (MAREP) was started in the 1980s and focuses exclusively on grid extension. It is financed through a 1% levy on electricity consumption and taxes on fuel imports.
q42,MW,2,No,A division of the Department of Energy runs the electrification programme. A draft of the new energy policy foresees creation of an ad hoc agency for MAREP. It will be responsible also for the promotion of renewable energy.
q43,MW,0,High,The budget for phase 8 of MAREP (May 2015 to March 2017) is MWK 12.1bn ($17m). It is financed through a 1% levy on electricity consumption and taxes on fuel imports. The government also allocated MWK 1bn ($1.4m) for rural electrification in 2016 (in a separate budget from MAREP).
q44,MW,0,Yes,The National Energy Policy (formulated in 2003) set a target to increase energy access to 30% by 2020 and 40% by 2050. The government also set a target to distribute two million clean and efficient cookstoves by 2020.
q45,MW,2,No,"No. However, the government is drafting a new national energy policy that will include a target for all public institutions (hospitals, schools, etc) to have access to electricity by 2035, either through grid connection and/or mini-grid/off-grid projects."
q46,MW,1,Somewhat,"Several international organisations are supporting the development of off-grid projects. The UNDP's initiative, for example, will issue 'requests for proposals' to public-private partnerships to deliver clean energy mini-grids, with the emphasis on build-own-operate business models. It aims to support 216 kW (peak) of mini-hydro mini-grids operated by Mulanje Electricity Generation Authority."
q47,MW,2,Low,"Single phase: $55 (MWK 40,000). 2-phase: $1,190 (MWK 850,000). 3-phase: $1,680 (MWK 1.2m). For connections 500 meters or more from the grid it is more expensive."
q48,MW,1,Somewhat,The cost of connection to the grid through ESCOM is about 50% lower than the cost of connecting privately. 
q49,MW,2,No,"The focus so far has been on extension of the main grid. However, the country's new energy policy is likely to give more attention to off-grid and mini-grid operators, with a potential budget allocated ad hoc."
q50,MW,2,No,"Pico solar products do not enjoy any VAT reductions compared with other products. Pico solar products are import duty-free, which according to the majority of licensed retailers, has encouraged a flood of low-quality products."
q51,MW,0,Yes,"EnDev (funded by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit; GIZ) is running a national awareness campaign to support the wider take-up of high-quality solar lighting products (solar lanterns and lighting kits), with a target of reaching 100,000 people, mainly in rural areas. Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves: the government of Malawi teamed up with the US and Ireland to promote the use of clean cookstoves. They set a target to distribute two million clean and efficient cookstoves by 2020. United Nations Development Programme's Increasing Access to Clean and Affordable Decentralised Energy Services in Selected Vulnerable Areas of Malawi programme aims to promote decentralised mini-grid applications across the country. The programme will run programmes and establish a national information clearing house to facilitate mini-grid-based rural electrification. BiF (Business Innovation Facilities) are funded by the UK-government's Department for International Development and support off-grid and mini-grid electrification activities. It gave business planning support to Mulanje Electricity Generation Authority for instance. The second phase, BiF-II, which began in 2014 supports and promotes supply chains for pico solar products (typically 1-10W). "
q53,MW,0,Yes,"SunnyMoney and RECAPO provide PAYG platforms. SunnyMoney is a social enterprise run by SolarAid, which sells small-scale solar products throughout eastern and southern Africa. After several school campaigns and two successful pilot campaigns funded by the Waterloo Foundation, the company is now offering its product nationwide. The lantern is the Sun King Eco Easy Buy and the developer of the PAYG technology used is Arganza. Fully charged it provides up to 30 hours of light. Rather than paying the high upfront cost, families make four monthly payments of MWK 2,000 each (around $2.88), which is less than the average spend on kerosene. The light then belongs to the family for the rest of its three-year lifespan. RECAPO's lease-to-buy model requires a one-time installation fee before its Indigo Solar Home System is installed. Clients then activate the system in seven-day periods by purchasing activation cards at various outlets, or via Airtel money. After 80 activations the system belongs to the client. "
q54,MW,2,No,"No quality standards have been implemented. Most NGOs reference standards used by Lighting Africa, a joint initiative of the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank."
q55,MW,2,No,"There was a subsidy for diesel, but it has been removed."
q56,MW,1,Medium,The standard VAT rate applies. 
q57,MW,2,No,Pico solar products do not enjoy any VAT reductions compared with other products.
q58,MW,0,Yes,"Pico solar products are import duty-free, which according to the majority of licensed retailers, has encouraged a flood of low-quality products."
q59,MW,0,Yes,"Corruption, particularly the payment of bribes, may occur at the border.  "
q60,MW,0,Yes,"The main challenges to the growth of the off-grid market lie mainly in affordability, but also in awareness and product trust. People are not aware of the benefits of solar and there is no clarity on quality standards and their implementation. Customers tend to turn away from quality products after having experienced dissatisfaction with low-quality ones."
q61,MW,2,Low,Duty-free
q23,MZ,0,Yes,"There is no regulation prohibiting mini-grids and small power projects for self-use. However, the development of power plants requires a concession from the government. "
q24,MZ,1,Somewhat,"FUNAE, the rural electrification agency, is in the process of identifying sites for mini-grids. It will then conduct feasibility studies on these sites and trial different ways of allocating the rights to build and operate a mini-grids. The agency is still at a very early stage in this process and it is unclear when the first concessions will be available."
q25,MZ,0,Yes,Generation projects with a power output of greater that 100MVA require approval from the Council of Ministers. There is currently no regulation governing the size of mini-grid projects. Only small pilot projects have been developed thus far. 
q26,MZ,1,Somewhat,"Developers go to FUNAE, the rural electrification agency, to get regulatory approval for a mini-grid or small generation project. "
q27,MZ,2,No,"Given the lack of project development thus far in Mozambique, there is no team at EDM dedicated to developers' requirements."
q28,MZ,2,No,"There is no set regulatory procedure for setting up small power projects or mini-grids. The Mozambican government has received a grant from the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa earmarked for, amongst other things, the development of a mini-grid regulatory framework."
q29,MZ,2,No,There are no set feed-in tariffs or permitted tariffs for on- or off-grid projects. The Mozambican government has received a grant from the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa earmarked for the development of a mini-grid regulatory framework with a focus on the design and implementation of a tariff structure.
q30,MZ,2,No,There are no set feed-in tariffs or permitted tariffs for on- or off-grid projects. The Mozambican government has received a grant from the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa earmarked for the development of a mini-grid regulatory framework with a focus on the design and implementation of a tariff structure.
q31,MZ,2,No,"There currently no set feed-in tariffs or permitted tariffs for off-grid projects. For on-grid projects, power purchase agreements (PPA) are negotiated on a case-by-case basis."
q32,MZ,1,Somewhat,There is no standardised PPA. They are negotiated on a case-by-case basis.
q33,MZ,2,No,"There is no standardised PPA duration for either on- or off-grid projects. No commercial off-grid projects have been developed to date. However, EDM has signed PPAs with IPPs that were negotiated on a case-by-case basis."
q34,MZ,0,Yes,"The National Transmission Grid Regulation states that EDM, as the Mozambican transmission concessionaire, is obliged to enter into agreements for the transmission of electricity with any generation concessionaire. "
q35,MZ,0,Yes,The process and standards for applying for a generation concession and connection of projects to the grid are clearly set out in policy.
q36,MZ,2,No,"There are no official policies in place. However, FUNAE is creating rules that it hopes will help promote investment in the mini-grid space."
q37,MZ,0,Yes,The Electricity Master Plan for Development of the National Grid 2005-2019 outlines national grid extension plans.
q38,MZ,0,Yes,"Act 21/97 (1 October,1997) stipulates conditions for service standards for power generation concessionaires."
q39,MZ,0,Yes,There is no regulation preventing power producers from offering financial services to consumers.
q41,MZ,0,Yes,"The rural electrification programme is carried out by Fundo de Energia (FUNAE), an agency under the Ministry of Energy. "
q42,MZ,0,Yes,FUNAE is the dedicated rural electrification agency.
q43,MZ,1,Average,"This is the figure stated in the country's Grid Extension Strategy of 2011. It mentions the reliance on donor aid funding (65% of the total, or $45.5m). How much is actually available for rural electrification is unclear. FUNAE's most recent annual report gives a figure of $30.5m for off-grid projects (excluding grid extension). "
q44,MZ,0,Yes,"A draft policy targets 50% electricity access by 2023, which is ambitious given the slow growth in electrification rates. "
q45,MZ,1,Somewhat,"FUNAE sees off-grid and mini-grid solutions as essential to its electrication strategy. However, there are no plans to use off-grid projects or mini-grids to meet energy access targets."
q46,MZ,1,Somewhat,"Thus far, commercial off-grid companies have yet to enter Mozambique. However, FUNAE, DFID and GIZ, the German government's international development agency, have all funded pilot off-grid projects."
q47,MZ,2,Low,"This price only applies to new connections in grid-connected areas, such as where neigbouring houses are connected to the grid. For connections further from the grid, the utility EDM requires a guaranteed minimum volume of electricity consumption per 100 metres of new transmission line. "
q48,MZ,1,Somewhat,"German development institution GIZ runs a programme that subsidises grid connections for poor households in electrified neighbourhoods. However, the programme is relatively small in the context of energy access in Mozambique, and in reality will only benefit a small proportion of households."
q49,MZ,2,No,There are no grants or incentives in place for off-grid or mini-grid operators.
q50,MZ,2,No,"Off-grid pico-solar products are not differentiated from general consumer goods, and are thus subject to the general tax rate of 17%. Off-grid pico-solar products are technically classified as ""intermediate beneficial goods"" under Mozambique's import laws, which means they qualify for a tariff of 7.5%. This is lower than most consumer goods. "
q51,MZ,0,Yes,Both FUNAE and German development organisation GIZ have developed mini-grid pilot projects and pico-solar programmes. The UK's Department for International Development (DFID) has undertaken a project to facilitate the entry of Kenya-based pay-as-you-go energy provider M-Kopa into Mozambique's pico-solar market.
q53,MZ,0,Yes,"There are mobile payment companies operating in Mozambique, but no pico-solar companies utilising these payment platforms. "
q54,MZ,2,No,"There are no quality standards in place for pico-solar products. As a result, the market is flooded with cheap Chinese imports."
q55,MZ,0,Yes,"There are significant fuel subisidies for both diesel and kerosene. An IMF report estimates that, in 2014, fuel subsidies reached 1.4% of GDP."
q56,MZ,1,Medium,"Off-grid pico-solar products are not differentiated from general consumer goods, and are thus subject to the general tax rate of 17%."
q57,MZ,2,No,"Off-grid pico-solar products are not differentiated from general consumer goods, and are thus subject to the general tax rate of 17%."
q58,MZ,2,No,"Off-grid pico-solar products are technically classified as ""intermediate beneficial goods"" under Mozambique's import laws, which means they qualify for a tariff of 7.5%. This is lower than most consumer goods. "
q59,MZ,1,Somewhat,"A 5% import tariff is levied on ""essential and capital goods"", 7.5% on ""intermediate beneficial goods"" and 20% on ""consumer products"". A report by GIZ states all of these rates have been applied to PV goods - different rates apply depending on the skills of the clearance agent and the acceptance of custom officials. This implies a lack of capacity in customs officals, and corroborates unverified claims of corruption amongst officials."
q60,MZ,1,Somewhat,There are no other regulations imposed on businesses operating in the off-grid solar market.
q61,MZ,2,Low,"A 5% import tariff is levied on ""essential and capital goods"", 7.5% on ""intermediate beneficial goods"" and 20% on ""consumer products"". A report by GIZ states all of these rates have been applied to PV tariffs - which rate applies depends on the skills of the clearance agent and the acceptance of custom officials."
q23,MM,0,Yes,The Myanmar Electricity Law of 2014 authorises states and regions to issue permits for projects up to 30MW and gives the MOEE permitting authority for projects over 30MW.
q24,MM,2,No,
q25,MM,1,Somewhat,"The Myanmar Electricity Law of 2014 defines a ""small"" project as 10MW or less."
q26,MM,1,Somewhat,"Depending on the size of the project, a developer needs to seek regulatory approval from either the MOEE or relevant state or regional agency."
q27,MM,1,Somewhat,"In general, a mini-grid or small power project will require a construction permit, registration of the developer as a local corporation and issuance of a certificate of incorporation as well as trade permits. Depending on the project size, environmental permits also are required. Relevant ministries of the national government have permitting offices. At the state and regional level permitting may be incorporated within business licensing offices."
q28,MM,1,Somewhat,"A power purchase agreement (PPA), if present, may incorporate a mechanism that enables recovery of new costs resulting from a change in law or regulation occurring after the PPA's execution."
q29,MM,0,Yes,"Tariffs on new projects involving offtake by the Myanmar government are negotiated. To date, the pricing in at least one new generation project was determined by competitive bid."
q30,MM,0,Yes,"Negotiated tariffs in which the offtaker is the Myanmar government may include price escalators, indexes, arbitration clauses and other mechanisms intended to promote the PPA's long-term durability."
q31,MM,1,Somewhat,"Tariff structures in PPAs, in which the offtaker is the Myanmar government, may be negotiated."
q32,MM,2,No,"Not yet. The history of third-party project development in Myanmar is too short for standardisation to have emerged. However, projects supported by multilateral development agencies have relied on similar documentation."
q33,MM,0,Yes,"The largest non-hydro third-party development to date, Sembcorp's 225MW Myingyan natural gas generation project in the Mandalay region, includes a 22-year PPA in which MEPE's payment obligations are guaranteed by MOEE."
q34,MM,1,Somewhat,Third-party project PPAs to date include a minimum-take obligation that may or may not be equal to 100% of the project's output.
q35,MM,2,No,A grid connection code has not yet been developed.
q36,MM,2,No,A grid extension timetable has not yet been released.
q37,MM,1,Somewhat,"There are currently two grid-extension plans: the National Electrification Plan, released in 2015, and the Electric Power Master Plan (EPMP), which has not been released formally but has been distributed to relevant government ministries. The National Electrification Plan covers extension of the low- and medium-voltage distribution network and off-grid power development in rural areas. The EPMP focuses on generation and high-voltage transmission. Both plans envision universal grid access by 2030, but the EPMP's specific generation and transmission schedules have not been released."
q38,MM,2,No,
q39,MM,2,No,
q41,MM,0,Yes,"Myanmar's 2014 National Electrification Plan specifies universal access to electricity for all  by 2030 in three phases: 50% access by 2020, 75% access by 2025 and 100% access by 2030."
q42,MM,0,Yes,"The Department of Rural Development (DRD) within the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation, heads off-grid electrification. Grid extension is headed by the Ministry of Energy and Electricity."
q43,MM,0,High,"The capex needed for grid extension is estimated at ~$80m in 2016 and 2017 (excluding technical assistance expenditures). A DRD presentation gives a budget of MMK 36,298m ($31.2m) in FY 2015-2016 for off-grid electrification. A total need of $5.8bn ($800 per connection) is cited by multiple sources for the 2015-2030 period. This estimate is in multiple World Bank statements going back to 2014. "
q44,MM,0,Yes,"Myanmar's 2014 National Electrification Plan specifies universal access to electricity for all by 2030 in three phases: 50% access by 2020, 75% access by 2025 and 100% access by 2030."
q45,MM,0,Yes,The National Electrification Plan explicitly includes mini-grids and off-grid generation for communities unlikely to gain grid access in the near-term.
q46,MM,0,Yes,The World Bank and IFC are sponsoring off-grid initiatives. 
q47,MM,1,Average,Estimates range from $250 to $412 per household for grid extension (total investment divided by the 2020 household connection goal contained in the National Electrification Plan).
q48,MM,1,Somewhat,"The need to taper subsidies to the point of elimination has been raised, but no timetable for elimination has been established."
q49,MM,0,Yes,"According to the National Electrification Plan, DRD is to offer a 10% incentive for mini-grid development."
q50,MM,2,No,

q57,MM,2,No,
q58,MM,2,No,
q59,MM,1,Somewhat,
q60,MM,1,Somewhat,The absence of licensing allows for a wide selection of off-grid solar products but low quality and absence of warranty protection or after-sale service of some products puts buyers at risk of non-performance and may damage the reputational image of off-grid solar technology.
q61,MM,2,Low,
q23,NP,0,Yes,"No licence is required, only a permit issued by the AEPC upon approval. "
q24,NP,1,Somewhat,"There are no formal concessions, but specific sites are agreed, or tendered for, and backed by 35-year PPAs or rules for grid interconnection. "
q25,NP,1,Somewhat,"1MW is the largest known mini-grid project although, in theory, the AEPC is allowed to issue permits for mini-grids of up to 10MW."
q26,NP,1,Somewhat,The AEPC is the focal point for off-grid and mini-grid projects.
q27,NP,1,Somewhat,"The AEPC issues permits for mini-grid projects, but the developer also requires clearance from both the Environment Ministry and Department of Industries."
q28,NP,1,Somewhat,"Mini-grids do not require a licence, only a permit (which does not require payment). However, clearance from the Environment Ministry and Department of Industries does incur transaction fees. "
q29,NP,0,Yes,"Off-grid power tariffs are decided by the community or entity that set it up. However, for grid-connected systems, power producers have to sell at a price determined by the NEA, which is standardised. "
q30,NP,1,Somewhat,There is some uncertainty over tariff duration as a system or mini-grid could be connected to the grid and would then become subject to NEA's tariffs. The tariffs can also be revised periodically by the committee.
q31,NP,1,Somewhat,The community that sets up the off-grid system decides the price and is guided by the AEPC. It varies. 
q32,NP,0,Yes,"Nepal developed a standardised PPA under the Small Hydro Promotion Programme, which began in 2000."
q33,NP,0,Yes,Nepal has a long track record of attracting hydro IPPs and offers 35-year PPAs.
q34,NP,0,Yes,NEA is the only off-taker and is obliged to buy all the power fed into the grid. 
q35,NP,0,Yes,The AEPC offers a range of technical standards and guidelines for different technologies and project types.
q36,NP,1,Somewhat,"There are clear rules on technical compatibility, but the subsidy or remuneration level in the event of grid arrival is determined on a case-by-case basis."
q37,NP,1,Somewhat,"The NEA publishes a list of grid projects and grid maps, including transmission lines under construction in its annual reports. Approval by the utility or the AEPC can be determined by checking against grid plans."
q38,NP,0,Yes,The AEPC offers a range of technical standards and guidelines. It also administers a technical review committee that performs a quality check on installations.
q39,NP,2,No,"Tariffs are mandated by the AEPC or NEA, and it is not clear that developers (and rural cooperatives) are able to tailor them flexibly."
q41,NP,0,Yes,"The National Rural Electrification Programme (NREP) is administered by the NEA. Off-grid power projects and mini-grids fall under the remit of the National Rural and Renewable Energy Programme (NRREP), which is run by the Alternate Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC)."
q42,NP,0,Yes,The AEPC administers all rural and clean energy programmes.
q43,NP,1,Average,"The NEA does not report specific grid extension expenditure. The figure of $152m for 2014/15 is based on total capital expenditure of NRP 59bn ($551m; including generation projects), of which NRP 3.7bn ($34.6m) was for various distribution system reinforcements. NRP 21m ($196.2m) was earmarked for the cross-border power transmission company, but does not list annual expenditure on transmission, which is likely to be high, with multiple projects listed in the annual report. If we assume that transmission and distribution was 30% of total capital expenditure, this gives us $126m, to which we add the NRREP expenditure of $26m."
q44,NP,1,Somewhat,"The Renewable Energy Policy 2006 and the NRREP programmes aim to increase energy access and thereby reduce poverty, but have set no specific access targets. However, there is a plan detailing the number of systems likely to be installed in micro/mini-hydro and small solar systems. "
q45,NP,0,Yes,"NRREP is entirely centred on renewable energy, which is largely deployed in rural areas as either off-grid projects or mini-grid systems. "
q46,NP,0,Yes,The AEPC offers capital subsidies of up to 50% for off-grid systems. 
q47,NP,2,Low,"This figure is according to the World Bank, which cites the Nepal Electricity Authority."
q48,NP,2,No,The capital subsidies are for equipment only. 
q49,NP,0,Yes,"The AEPC offers capital subsidies of up to 50% for off-grid systems, of which 90% is disbursed to the developers on installation and the other 10% is made available after a brief period of performance monitoring. "
q50,NP,1,Somewhat,Products that are approved by the AEPC's Renewable Energy Test Station are eligible for a VAT waiver (as well as subsidies). The standard VAT rate of 13% applies to other open-market products. Import taxes for clean energy products is as low as 1.5% and power produced by plants under 1MW are exempt from income tax. 
q51,NP,0,Yes,"The AEPC runs a comprehensive off-grid solar market-building programme, supported by a wide range of donors, including GIZ and SNV Netherlands Development Organisation among others."
q53,NP,2,No,"Bangladeshi business group Rahimafrooz uses a proprietary smartphone app for its sales agents to track payments, but customers do not yet use technology-enabled PAYG. The company is likely to roll this out in the coming years."
q54,NP,1,Somewhat,Technical standards are available on the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre website.
q55,NP,0,Yes,"Prices are regulated by the Nepal Oil Corporation, which is the sole purveyor of petroleum products. It faced severe supply shortages in the latter half of 2015 due to the blockade by India, its sole source of imports. It has explored lowering the subsidy by adopting a dual pricing structure, whereby industrial consumers would be exposed to cost-reflective prices. Kerosene is VAT exempt."
q56,NP,1,Medium,Products that are approved by the AEPC's Renewable Energy Test Station are eligible for a VAT waiver (as well as subsidies). The standard VAT rate of 13% applies to other open-market products.
q57,NP,1,Somewhat,Products that are approved by the AEPC's Renewable Energy Test Station are eligible for a VAT waiver (as well as subsidies). The standards VAT rate of 13% appears to apply to other open market products.
q58,NP,0,Yes,"Import taxes for clean energy products are as low as 1.5%, and power produced by plants under 1MW are exempt from income tax. "
q59,NP,1,Somewhat,None disclosed by market participants.
q60,NP,1,Somewhat,Products must be approved by the AEPC's Renewable Energy Test Station to qualify for subsidies and VAT exemption. Market participants view this as helpful for upholding quality standards.
q61,NP,2,Low,"See section 15.2(g) of Nepal's Customs Tariffs, available in the associated policy record."
q23,NG,0,Yes,There are no legal restrictions on setting up a mini-grid.
q24,NG,0,Yes,"Developers usually acquire their own land when developing mini-grids. However, the government has set aside some land for developers to build mini-grids."
q25,NG,0,Yes,"There is no threshold. However, projects with a nameplate capacity of 1MW and above (which are classified as 'captive' or 'embedded self-generation') require a permit from NERC. Any project of 1MW or more is subject to power sector regulations, whether on- or off-grid."
q26,NG,1,Somewhat,The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) issues generation permits for projects above 1MW.
q27,NG,2,No,There is no team dedicated to liaising with developers. 
q28,NG,0,Yes,The lack of regulatory procedures make it relatively easy to set up a mini-grid or off-grid project. 
q29,NG,0,Yes,"Tariffs are calculated using a 'levelised-cost-of-energy' approach and negotiated with the bulk trader (NBET), subject to a cap determined by the 'multi-year tariff order' (MYTO) policy. They take into account capital expenditure and operating expenditure, capacity factors and developers' internal rate of return hurdles, which implies cost recovery is feasible."
q30,NG,0,Yes,"Tariffs for utility-scale projects are subject to the MYTO policy as a cap. Once the tariffs have been agreed with NBET they are stable for 20 years. The MYTO is subject to a major review every five years (however, revised rates only apply to new applicants). A PPA it is typically guaranteed with minimal risk for 20 years. In Q4 2015, a feed-in tariff for embedded generation was introduced - it relates specifically to wind and biomass projects of less than 10MW, solar of less than 5MW and small hydro of less than 30MW. Embedded generation tariffs are not agreed with NBET, meaning that developers have to deal directly with the distribution companies, which is more risky."
q31,NG,1,Somewhat,"If generators present a case justifying their costs to NBET they can get a tariff that compensates them sufficiently, particularly if Nigeria goes down the route of auctions, which they intend on implementing."
q32,NG,2,No,"Nigeria has a feed-in tariff (FiT) that can be tailored, depending on the generating company. No power producer can get more than the FiT specified by MYTO II (the latest tariff policy)."
q33,NG,0,Yes,"MYTO II specifies a 15-year tariff. However, PPAs signed with NBET are typically 20 years. FiTs for embedded power are set for 20 years."
q34,NG,1,Somewhat,"Under separate PPAs with each power generating company, both thermal and hydro, NBET buys all power generated. "
q35,NG,0,Yes,"NBET enters into separate PPAs with each power generating company, both thermal and hydro."
q36,NG,2,No,There are no rules governing the merger of a mini-grid or off-grid project into the main grid.
q37,NG,1,Somewhat,"There is no official source for the national grid expansion map, although there are various unofficial maps. Nigeria has a grid expansion plan that is designed to enable it to meet its 100% electrification target by 2030. The programme will require average investment of $2bn annually and should electrify an additional 1.68m homes per year. The Rural Electrification Agency (REA) has a fund dedicated to carrying out this work."
q38,NG,0,Yes,"The documentation exists, but enforcement does not. See the Standards Organisation of Nigeria http://son.gov.ng/frequently-asked-questions/. Standards have become more important since privatisation. "
q39,NG,0,Yes,Some mini-grid developers use pay-as-you-go tariffs with net-metering where the consumer can use their mobile phone credit or bank account to pay for power.
q41,NG,0,Yes,"The programme was allocated money in 2015, but it was not deployed so far. In 2014, it had a budget of NGN 17bn to NGN 20bn ($54.8m to $64.4m), approximately 38% of which was released.  The programme awards contracts for the installation of transmission lines and diesel generators. The Rural Electrification Authority (REA) has a fund dedicated to lighting up rural communities. "
q42,NG,0,Yes,"The Rural Electrification Agency (REA) is mandated to extend the grid to rural areas and to support the creation of and access to micro-grids where appropriate, which it does via the Rural Electrification Fund (REF)."
q43,NG,2,Low,
q44,NG,0,Yes,
q45,NG,2,No,The national electrification target is 75% by 2020 and 100% by 2030.
q46,NG,0,Yes,The Bank of Industry and Central Bank fund small-scale off-grid renewable power projects.
q47,NG,1,Average,"If a power line is present in a community consumers can apply to their local distribution company for a connection. There is no formal process and the cost varies. A construction firm in Lagos estimated the cost of a new connection was between NGN 100,000 to NGN 150,000 ($317 to $475)."
q48,NG,2,No,No grants are offered to households on connection to the grid.
q49,NG,2,No,There is no record of government grants made available to project developers. 
q50,NG,2,No,"PV panels and modules are exempt from paying the 5% VAT rate, whereas entire PV systems are not. However, as most solar systems are shipped 'bundled', it can be hard to get 0% duty on the panels. Some small and medium-sized enterprises import solar equipment through neighbouring Benin’s duty-free port at Cotonou, then transport the solar equipment overland to Niger and from there into Nigeria. "
q51,NG,0,Yes,"Germany's Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the UK's Department for International Development, Solar Nigeria and USAid have off-grid energy programmes running in schools and hospitals, among other places. The state-backed Lagos Energy Academy runs courses on renewable energy-related technologies."
q53,NG,0,Yes,"It is common for consumers linked to mini-grids in Nigeria to use mobile phone credit to buy power, which is tracked using net-metering. Nova Lumos, for instance, offers a 82W solar panel with a battery that can be bought on a one, two or five-year pay-off plan. Customers use pre-paid credit on their phones to get access to the power the panel delivers."
q54,NG,0,Yes,"Nigeria does not have its own standards codes. Instead, it uses international standard codes.  More information on standards can be found on the SON website http://son.gov.ng/frequently-asked-questions/."
q55,NG,0,Yes,"There are subsidies for kerosene and gasoline, but not diesel. Sixty percent of households use gasoline-fired generators. Larger generators tend to use diesel."
q56,NG,2,Low,"Pico-solar systems are subject to 5% VAT, but panels shipped alone are exempt."
q57,NG,1,Somewhat,"PV panels and modules are exempt from paying the 5% VAT rate, whereas entire PV systems are not."
q58,NG,1,Somewhat,"PV panels and modules are the only products exempt from paying duty (in contrast, batteries have to pay a 20%). However, as most solar systems are shipped 'bundled', it can be hard to get 0% duty on the panels. Some small and medium-sized enterprises import solar equipment through neighbouring Benin’s duty-free port at Cotonou, then transport the solar equipment overland to Niger and from there into Nigeria. "
q59,NG,1,Somewhat,Port operations tend to be inefficient.
q60,NG,0,Yes,NA
q61,NG,2,Low,"It is possible to get zero rate duty, but it takes effort and time. The latter can be costly as storage is expensive."
q23,PK,0,Yes,"It is possible to set up a small power project, subject to approval from the NEPRA. In late 2015, for instance, business conglomerate the Fatima Group secured permission to build transmission lines to deliver power from their soon-to-be-commissioned coal and biomass cogeneration power plant in Muzaffargarh. "
q24,PK,2,No,"Pakistan does not yet have a mini-grid policy. However, one has been proposed and is currently under review. The government has started to give licences to private players to set up power infrastructure with exclusive ownership and control to connect new plants to the national grid. Such licences are being issued under special provisions and by somewhat curtailing the authority of the National Transmission Dispatch Company (NTDC). It is now possible for private power developers to generate and transmit power with exclusive control on the transmission lines and sell the power on a business-to-business basis."
q25,PK,1,Somewhat,"There is no limit on the size of a small power project. However, there are restrictions on the size of solar and wind plants eligible for upfront feed-in-tariffs."
q26,PK,1,Somewhat,"The Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB), created in 1994, is a 'one window facilitator' to promote private sector participation. PPIB helps investors establish private power projects and related infrastructure, executes implementation agreements with project sponsors, and issues sovereign guarantees on behalf of the government. It is the only agency a private power project developer needs to deal with."
q27,PK,2,No,There are no dedicated departments within the utilities that cater to the needs and requirements of the developers.
q28,PK,1,Somewhat,"The standardised regulatory procedure is composed of five steps. 1. Submission of the project proposal and registration. 2. Evaluation/approval of the proposal by PPIB. 3. Issuance of a letter of intent by PPIB. 4. Tariff determination and issuance of generation license by NEPRA. 5. Issuance of a letter of support by PPIB. The process normally takes about seven months to complete, in line with many other countries, but bureaucratic issues may mean it takes longer."
q29,PK,0,Yes,"Tariffs are based on a return on investment in the project. The Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) claims they provide a return of around 17-18% on equity. Until very recently, Pakistan provided very generous feed-in-tariffs for wind and solar power projects. However, NEPRA has reduced the tariffs year-on-year in a bid to avoid over-subsidising projects. "
q30,PK,0,Yes,"Upfront tariffs are signed for long durations - solar for 25 years, wind for 20 years, small hydro (1MW to 25MW) for 30 years, and biomass (bagasse-based co-generation) for 30 years. There has never been a case of retroactive tariff cuts."
q31,PK,2,No,"Power tariffs are determined by NEPRA. Project developers can file a petition for review of the tariffs, however the final decision rests with NEPRA."
q32,PK,0,Yes,"There is a standardised PPA for all kinds of power projects. They are available on the AEDB, private power and infrastructure board websites. (Standardised PPA for coal - http://www.ppib.gov.pk/PPAImportedCoal.pdf. Standardised PPA for bagasse - http://www.aedb.org/index.php/ju-elibrary/elib-bioenergy/elib-bio-stdocs.

q33,PK,0,Yes,"PPAs are normally offered for at least 20 years, reflecting the guaranteed life of the technology. Solar PPAs are for 25 years, wind for 20 years, small hydro (1 MW to 25MW) for 30 years, and bagasse-based co-generation for 30 years."
q34,PK,0,Yes,The Alternative and Renewable Energy Policy 2011 mandates the power distribution companies and the NTDC to purchase all the power generated by renewable energy projects.
q35,PK,0,Yes,"NEPRA clearly specifies the grid connection, transmission and distribution voltages. Specifications governing responsibility for financing, building & operating interconnection facilities and power transmission and distribution are also clearly laid down. "
q36,PK,1,Somewhat,"There is no explicit policy or code pertaining to mini-grids. However, there are rules in the Alternative and Renewable Energy Policy 2011 about connecting distributed generation facilities to the national grid"
q37,PK,2,No,"While the authorities have long-term goals to privatise transmission and distribution companies and extend the national grid to remote locations under the rural electrification scheme, they have not yet made any of the plans public."
q38,PK,0,Yes,NEPRA has set out clear standards for all power producers. The regulator has the authority to impose fines on IPPs if they do not adhere to the mandatory guidelines.
q39,PK,2,No,"Power companies are not permitted to offer financial services directly to consumers. Moreover, the power utilities are financially stressed and lack the capability to offer financing to consumers. Their priority is collecting payments from consumers rather than offering easier financial terms. "
q41,PK,1,Somewhat,"There is no formal programme with clear targets and a primary objective of rural electrification. However, the 2006 Policy for Development of Renewable Energy for Power Generation contains an objective to provide energy for all. "
q42,PK,1,Somewhat,"There is no dedicated agency for rural electrification in Pakistan. While AEDB has taken up specific rural electrification programmes in the past, rural electrification is not a key policy objective."
q43,PK,2,Low,There is no annual budget for rural electrification in Pakistan. 
q44,PK,2,No,"The country set an 'electricity for all' target to be achieved in 2007. However, progress has been very slow. While efforts have been made to achieve 100% electrification, the agenda switched post-2005 to adding generation capacity to meet growing demand."
q45,PK,2,No,"There are no clear objectives to add mini-grids and off-grid power projects to achieve energy access targets. However, off-grid solutions are becoming increasingly popular for electrification in rural areas. The Buksh Foundation along with The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) of India have electrified 72 off-grid villages in the Punjab province of Pakistan. They now plan to electrify 4,000 off-grid villages by 2017. Similarly, the provincial government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa plans to supply solar power to 200 villages. "
q46,PK,0,Yes,"IFC is working on off-grid market development, and has committed $4m over four years specifically aimed at providing lighting solutions in the country. In November 2015, Asian Development Bank approved $1.4bn for power sector reforms in Pakistan. "
q47,PK,2,Low,"The security deposit is between PKR 800 ($7.7) and PKR 1,900 ($18.2). Line costs range from PKR 4,000 ($38.3) to PKR 6,000 ($57.4) for consumers close to the existing grid. For lines in excess of 40 metres from the grid, the charge is PKR 200 ($1.9) per meter."
q48,PK,1,Somewhat,The costs of new connection are subsidised by the distribution companies.
q49,PK,0,Yes,"There is no policy on incentives for off-grid/mini-grid power projects in Pakistan. The State Bank of Pakistan, however, offers fixed interest rate loans (currently 6%) for a period of 10 years to renewable energy projects of up to 10MW."
q50,PK,2,No,"There are no VAT exemptions for solar goods compared with other products. Although there is a policy exempting solar PV equipment from import duty, the Federal Board of Revenue imposes a 5% import duty."
q51,PK,0,Yes,USAID is working with AEDB on a proposal that renewable energy takes a share of the future energy mix. IRENA is conducting a 'renewables readiness' assessment of the energy market (both off-grid and grid-connected) that will identify strengths and weaknesses and propose possible solutions. GIZ is following up on its previous project 'Renewable Energies and Energy Efficiency'. The World Bank is engaged in a renewable energy resource mapping project with AEDB. The IFC is working on off-grid market development specifically aimed at providing lighting solutions. Other agencies like UNIDO and Asian Development Bank are also active in off-grid market development.
q53,PK,0,Yes,Ecoenergy Finance and Nizam Energy are currently operating PAYG services in the country. Telenor's Easypaisa mobile money app is also available.
q54,PK,2,No,"There are no quality standards for solar products in Pakistan. In recent years, some poor quality solar products have been sold in the country, prompting the government, in conjunction with GIZ, to begin work on a standards guide. "
q55,PK,0,Yes,"Pakistan has heavily subsidised petrol, diesel and kerosene in the past. Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) has repeatedly asked the Government to reduce the subsidies however the government has refused to reduce the subsidy prices citing inflationary impact on the economy."
q56,PK,0,High,There is a general sales tax of 17% on solar products in Pakistan.
q57,PK,2,No,There are no exemptions for solar goods compared with other products.
q58,PK,0,Yes,"Although there is a policy exempting solar PV equipment from import duty, the Federal Board of Revenue imposes a 5% import duty."
q59,PK,0,Yes,"Delays in the release of off-grid products from the customs department, corruption and other bureaucratic problems are commonplace."
q60,PK,0,Yes,"While the risk perception of Pakistan has improved, there are security risks in certain parts of the country, which sometimes pose barriers to project installation. Land identification is a challenge for international developers and delays in approval of grid connection by the NTDC is another issue. Apart from these issues, no privately-financed solar project has reached financial close yet. The Central Power Purchasing Agency has stalled projects looking for feed-in tariffs as it waits for lower tariffs. There is a stand-off between NEPRA and CPPA in this regard. "
q61,PK,2,Low,PV modules: 5% import duty applies on PV modules in Pakistan.  Solar Home Systems: Import duty is 35% for systems not exceeding 1000V and 20% for systems under 1000V.   Solar lanterns: Import duty is exempted.  Batteries: Lithium ion and sealed lead acid batteries have an import duty of 10%.
q23,RW,0,Yes,"Development of mini-grids and small generation projects for self-use is permitted. The Rwandan Utility Regulatory Authority established a dedicated licensing regime for rural electrification in August 2015 that covers all mini-grid projects up to 1MW. Licences covering all aspects of mini-grid operations, from generation through to retail, are available, as are isolated distribution-grid-only licenses that cover distribution and retail for periods ranging from five to 25 years. Grids of less than 50kW are exempt from licensing, but must notify the authorities. Projects of more than 1MW fall  under the on-grid regime. Processing times for licences must not exceed 60 days."
q24,RW,0,Yes,Licence holders are awarded exclusive rights to distribute and retail electricity in a geographic area that is defined in their license. Non-exclusive rights to generate power are awarded for five to 25 years (10 years is the indicated period). Further generation licences may be awarded if demand is not met in an area.
q25,RW,1,Somewhat,"To qualify for the simplified licensing procedure the threshold is 1MW for mini-grids and 5MW for small power producer licenses. Larger projects can be developed, but are not covered by the current regulation. It is assumed that, given the small size of Rwanda and low levels of demand in remote areas, the utility would take measures to connect such projects to the main grid if the opportunity arose. In this case, the developer would likely be limited to a generator licence."
q26,RW,1,Somewhat,"The Rwandan Utility Regulatory Authority established a dedicated licensing regime for rural electrification in August 2015 that covers all mini-grid projects up to 1MW. Other strategic stakeholders such as the Rwanda Development Board, Rwanda Energy Group and the Ministry of Infrastructure practice an 'open door policy' and support the private sector."
q27,RW,1,Somewhat,"The Rwandan Utility Regulatory Authority is the main body awarding licences and reviewing the technical requirements of projects. However, the Energy Development Corporation, a subsidiary of state-owned utility REG, also has a department dedicated to electrification."
q28,RW,0,Yes,"The Rwandan Utility Regulatory Authority established a dedicated licensing regime for rural electrification in August 2015 that covers all mini-grid projects of up to 1MW. It is stipulated that processing times for licenses must not exceed 60 days. The government has pledged to standardise the tendering procedure as much as possible to reduce transaction costs. Feed-in tariff legislation has also been in use, although is not currently active (there are plans to award feed-in tariff contracts to a further 10MW of solar projects)."
q29,RW,0,Yes,"Under the simplified licensing procedure designed by the Rwanda Utility Regulatory Authority, project developers can set their tariffs so as to recover the cost of operating the grid (including depreciation charges and fuel cost) and make a reasonable rate of return on the net fixed value of the generation and distribution assets. Any subsidies or grants received to reduce the tariff level are included in the calculation. Accounting must be kept ready for inspection. Over remuneration in one fiscal year must be compensated by a tariff reduction the following year.  "
q30,RW,0,Yes,Project developers set their tariffs so as to recover the cost of operating the grid (including depreciation charges and fuel cost) and make a reasonable rate of return on the net fixed value of the generation and distribution assets.
q31,RW,0,Yes,"Under the simplified licensing procedure designed by the Rwanda Utility Regulatory Authority, project developers can set their own tariffs. "
q32,RW,1,Somewhat,"All PPAs awarded are 'take-or-pay' contracts of 20 to 25 years duration. The feed-in tariff is a standardised agreement that historically has been available to hydro projects only. Once the new budget is cleared, the tariff could also be awarded to around 10MW of solar and bioenergy. The Energy Development Corporation prefers to use tenders to award new contracts and follows a standardised procedure were possible as set out in the 2015 electricity sector strategy."
q33,RW,0,Yes,"All the PPAs awarded are 20 to 25-year contracts. Rural electrification licenses are awarded for periods ranging from five to 25 years, with 10 years being an indicative period for mini-grid projects and 15 years for generation projects."
q34,RW,0,Yes,All PPAs awarded are 'take-or-pay' 20- to 25-year contracts. The feed-in tariff is a standardised agreement historically only available to hydro. Holders of mini-grid licences that are connected to third-party generation projects are also obliged to take all the power produced.
q35,RW,0,Yes,"The Rwanda Utility Regulatory Authority published the first version of its grid codes in 2012. These established rules and procedures for all participants, including extensive reporting obligations for all stakeholders, which make it one of the best markets for access to information."
q36,RW,0,Yes,"If the main grid arrives within connecting distance of a mini-grid project, the licence holder must choose one of three options: 1) Switch the licence to a small power distribution and generation licence, which will be valid for the remainder of the original licence period (effectively splitting the business into a generator that sells to the grid and qualifies for feed-in tariffs, and an electricity retailer that buys from it). 2) Negotiate the acquisition of the project by the national utility. 3) Relocate the assets, where possible, in exchange for a relocation fee and operate for the remainder of the licence period. Finally, in exceptional cases where connecting to the main grid would not benefit the local population, the regulator may decide to withhold the licence conversion."
q37,RW,0,Yes,"All off-grid electrification players surveyed confirmed that they had access to plans for grid extension. For security and political reasons, this information is not freely accessible online, but can easily be viewed via the Rwanda Utility Regulatory Authority or the Rwanda Energy Group.  "
q38,RW,0,Yes,"The Rwandan Utility Regulatory Authority reviews licence applicants’ technical proposals. Quality of service standards are established when a licence for a mini-grid and/or small power producer is awarded. The regulator can inspect to ensure compliance with the agreed specifications on an ad-hoc basis. For companies installing solar PV for private customers, the products used are subject to the Rwanda Bureau of Standards rules, which comply with national, regional and international standards on the import of the goods. The latter are set by Switzerland’s Société Générale de Surveillance, a global leader in the sector."
q39,RW,0,Yes,"Mini-grid and small power plant developers are free to structure payment for their services. For example, solar kit vendors have moved to longer repayment periods (10 years) to improve their value proposition to customers (as capacity to pay remains low in the country). Furthermore, a company could decide to apply for a micro-financing licence. However, this is a regulated activity that may unnecessarily increase red tape for the company. "
q41,RW,0,Yes,"Rwanda’s Electricity Access Roll-out Plan is run in phases. The current initiative began in 2012 and will run through to 2018. It aims to increase electricity access to 70% (48% through connection to the grid and 22% through off-grid solutions). The previous period ran from 2007 to 2012 and aimed to achieve 16% access, up from 6%. This target was very nearly achieved, which may have prompted the government to set ambitious targets for 2017. Rwanda is making significant progress, notably in laying down the policy environment that will allow it to achieve these targets and connect customers to the grid. A 2016 update is expected to give more clarity on progress with off-grid targets, which have lagged behind on-grid targets. "
q42,RW,0,Yes,"Rwanda’s Electricity Access Roll-out Plan is primarily managed by a dedicated team at state-owned utility REG. The regulator is responsible for the awarding of mini-grid and small power producer licences. In addition, the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program, managed by multilateral development initiative, Climate Investment Funds, approved the establishment (together with the Rwandan government) of the Renewable Energy Fund targeting electrification projects that should start disbursing funds from 2017."
q43,RW,1,Average,"The Electricity Access Roll-out Plan is heavily dependent on donor funding. Between 2011 and 2015, the budget was $50m to $60m per year and mostly spent on increasing grid connections (75,000 households per year were connected on average). However, to meet its on-grid objective, the government estimates that this must be increased to $130m per year, excluding off-grid electrification. Thus, support for off-grid projects will essentially have to come from foreign development agencies and donors on a case-by-case basis. This picture will change radically in 2016. Donor-supported tenders for the electrification of 500,000 homes have been launched. The European Union has signed a financing agreement worth EUR 177m ($196m) for the energy sector, with a particular focus on rural electrification. The Renewable Energy Fund, backed by the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program, should go live with initial backing of $50m. It is looking to attract support from other donors to reach a target of $180m, all of which will be dedicated to off-grid electrification through home power systems and mini-grids. The government estimates the volume of debt needed for off-grid PV home installations to be $100m in 2016-17. Targeted investment in the mini-grid segment is $65m, including around $30m in support."

q46,RW,0,Yes,"As of 2015, $6m in grants has been awarded to off-grid electrification projects by the government’s Environment and Climate Change Fund (FONERWA), with a further $6m available. Grant programmes from donor agencies have committed $13.4m to a variety of solar programmes, the largest of which is a European Union-funded $6m grant to electrify 49,000 households. Support looks set to accelerate soon as donor-supported tenders for the electrification of 500,000 homes have been launched. The European Union has signed a financing agreement worth EUR 177m ($196m) for the energy sector, with a particular focus on rural electrification.

q47,RW,0,High,"Consumers within 30 metres of the grid pay RWF 56,000 (around $70) in instalments over five years. The actual cost is considerably higher, at around RWF 560,000 ($700), and is subsidised mostly by the Electricity Access Rollout Program."
q48,RW,1,Somewhat,"Consumers within 30 metres of the grid pay RWF 56,000 (around $70) in instalments over five years. The actual cost is considerably higher, at around RWF 560,000 ($700), and is subsidised mostly by the Electricity Access Rollout Program."

q50,RW,0,Yes,"VAT exemption for energy products in Rwanda was extended in 2015 to include solar water heating systems, solar-powered pumping stations, solar appliances (including TV, radios and fridges) as well as renewable power generation equipment, including solar panels, batteries, inverters, trackers and wind generation equipment. Rwanda is part of East Africa’s customs union and as such applies the full exemption of import duty to all solar products, including storage and DC appliances."
q51,RW,2,No,"Government involvement in the development of mini-grids and off-grid solar systems has been limited owing to a lack of funding. Consequently, there is no market-building programme and off-grid solar companies have had to rely on their own awareness-raising campaigns. However, this is set to change thanks to a large solar tender that will target electrification of 500,000 homes and will include a market-building element. "
q53,RW,0,Yes,"Mobile money is very popular in Rwanda. A lot of companies are involved in the sector, including the global leaders MTN, TIGO and M-Pensa. They are all commonly used by off-grid solar companies to receive payments. However, integration into their internal platforms has been slightly more complicated than in neighbouring Tanzania and Kenya. "
q54,RW,2,No,"Solar product retailers are only subject to general electronic goods standards, as established by the Rwanda Bureau of Standards and enforced by Switzerland’s Société Générale de Surveillance, a global leader in the sector. The sector is dominated by high-quality brands (for example, Mobisol, Azuri and Ignite Power) as a consequence of the $13.4m in donor funding awarded to the sector to date."
q55,RW,0,Yes,"Due to Rwanda’s low levels of electricity access, the VAT exemption on kerosene was maintained in 2015.  "
q56,RW,2,Low,"VAT exemption for energy products in Rwanda was extended in 2015 to include solar water heating systems, solar-powered pumping stations, solar appliances (including TV, radios and fridges) as well as renewable power generation equipment, including solar panels, batteries, inverters, trackers and wind generation equipment.

q58,RW,0,Yes,"Rwanda is part of East Africa’s customs union and as such applies the full exemption of import duty to all solar products, including storage and DC appliances. Tanzania proposed amending this rule in 2015, but a strong reaction from the solar sector led to the extension of exemptions."
q59,RW,1,Somewhat,"Rwanda is a land-locked country and thus solar product importers may suffer disturbances at the harbours in neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania. However, the road network to Kigali is good and the logistics work well once the products are landed."
q60,RW,1,Somewhat,"The Rwandan government has done a lot to create an enabling environment for solar companies to thrive. The main challenge remains low income and consequentially low demand. The extensive donor-funded support programmes set go live in 2016/17 will help address this issue. Proliferation of poor quality products has not been an issue in Rwanda to date, but established companies are pushing for the introduction of standards to ensure this threat does not materialise."
q61,RW,2,Low,"Rwanda is part of East Africa’s customs union and as such applies the full exemption of import duty to all solar products, including storage and DC appliances. Tanzania proposed amending this rule in 2015, but a strong reaction from the solar sector led to the extension of exemptions."
q23,SN,0,Yes,"In Senegal, the setting up of a mini-grid or small power project with a total capacity of less than 50kW is legally possible without state interference. Power projects above 50kW must obtain a distribution license and supply the system of the national power company, Senelec, or one of the 10 rural electrification concession holders, or be developed as an individual project by local government. Rural electrification concessions are awarded through tenders. Winners are granted a 20-year monopoly on retail and generation, and a 20-year monopoly on supply of electricity in the concession. They are also granted the right to acquire any power project above 50kW developed by local government upon electrification of the project's area. Winners of the six tenders include EDF and the Moroccan office for electricity and water. The process to electrify areas is underway, although in some mining areas the government has had to step in to ensure households are electrified instead of simply local mining operations."
q24,SN,0,Yes,"Six concession areas have been allocated out of the total of 10, and there has been activity in three so far. The four remaining concessions will be granted once the regulator sees activity in all six already allocated. The distribution of the areas is as follows: 1. Concession Dagana – Podor – Saint – Louis allocated to à COMASEL (National Electricity and Water Office of Morocco or ONEE). 2. Concession  Louga – Linguère – Kébémer allocated to COMASEL (ONEE). 3. Concession Kaffrine – Tambacounda – Kédougou allocated to ERA (Partnership between EDF/Matforce CSI). 4. Concession Kaolack – Nioro – Fatick – Gossas allocated to EDR (Partnership ENCO/Isofoton Maroc). 5. Concession Kolda – Vélingara allocated to Kolda Energy (Partnership ENCO/Isofoton Maroc). 6. Concession Mbour allocated to SCL Energies  (Partnership STEG/COSELEC). Concession holders can buy wholesale electricity from Senelec at a 20% discount. "
q25,SN,1,Somewhat,"In Senegal, the setting up of a mini-grid or small power project of less than 50kW total installed capacity is legally possible without state interference. However, power systems with more than 50kW of installed capacity must be developed by or under a commercial agreement with the national power company, Senelec, or with one of Senegal's 10 rural electrification concession holders. One exception to this rule is the Rural Electrification Local Initiative, whereby local authorities can implement electrification projects that are not within the rural electrification agency's remit. In these cases, the installation, exploitation and maintenance is handled by a private company (selected through public tender), the national regulation agency fixes the price for consumers, and equipment remains the property of the government. "
q26,SN,1,Somewhat,Project developers must comply with the governance of the national rural electrification agency (ASER) and the national regulator (CRSE).
q27,SN,1,Somewhat,"Developers of projects under 50kW do not need to meet any electricity sector-specific requirements. Senegal's national power company, Senelec, has been stripped of all grid responsibilities following the promulgation of the 1998 electricity law. It is, however, mandated to support rural electrification concession holders in establishing technical requirements for connection to the main grid. The national regulator, CRSE, also provides project support and technical advice to developers. Within rural electrification concessions, the national agency for rural electrification acts as a one-stop-shop to discuss technical requirements for developers. Individual concession holders are also entitled to develop their own technical requirement framework."
q28,SN,1,Somewhat,"Inside Senegal's rural electrification concessions, the regulatory structure is relatively complex, but designed to minimize transaction costs. Retail prices for households are: i) decided upon granting of the concession, ii) designed as flat rates across three consumption levels to prevent metering costs except for large consumers, iii) updatable after an initial three-year period, then every five years, or in the case of major changes to production costs. Developers are further supported through the obligation of consumers to pay an initial connection fee and give a deposit equal to two months of consumption. Senelec has continued implementing rural electrification work, while concession activity has been held up. Senelec's tariffs are harmonised nationwide, unlike rural concession tariffs, which vary according to the region and are more expensive. This has led to misunderstandings and an unwillingness on the part of some villagers to pay higher rural concession tariffs for electricity, when other villages nearby pay cheaper tariffs to Senelec."
q29,SN,0,Yes,"Tariff levels are calculated by looking at the cost of service and the payment capacity of local people. In order that a project is profitable to developers, the government subsidises projects from 20% to 80% depending on the region in question and the purchasing power of the local people. Inside Senegal's rural electrification concessions, the tariff is supposed to provide a ""normal return on investment"" and can include a connection cost component. The tariff is essentially a feed-in tariff that is: i) decided upon granting of the concession, ii) split across three consumption levels to prevent metering costs (except for large consumers), and iii) updatable after an initial three-year period, then every five years, or if there are major changes to production costs. Developers may also recoup the initial investment VAT component through VAT exemptions on the selling of electricity. Further softening of tariffs through the use of development finance is authorised. The risk of default is mitigated through a two-month consumption deposit and an initial connection fee for consumers. "
q30,SN,1,Somewhat,"Developers of projects under 50kW are not subject to any electricity tariff regulation. Tariffs move in accordance with an index and can be adjusted four times a year by grid operator Senelec, and twice a year by rural concession holders. Tariffs vary widely across Senegal and are more expensive in rural areas than in cities. CRSE is currently working on a project to harmonise tariffs across the whole country so that they are realigned and equalised in all regions. Mechanisms to do so could include state compensation, a stabilisation pot or realignment. Tariffs regulated by Senelec are more stable across the country than those of independent producers, because Senelec provides power via both the main network and off-grid structures. This can sometimes create difficulties for ASER concession holders to electrify areas where villagers are conscious of Senelec's cheaper tariffs and are not welcome to the idea of paying higher rural concession tariffs."
q31,SN,1,Somewhat,"Developers of projects under 50kW are not subject to any electricity tariff regulation. Inside concessions, concession holders or power producers are subject to the tariff structure decided upon awarding of the concession. The tariff is i) essentially a feed-in tariff ii) split across three consumption levels to prevent metering costs (except for large consumers), and iii) updatable after an initial three-year period, then every five years or if there are major changes to production costs."
q32,SN,2,No,"Developers of projects under 50kW are not subject to any electricity tariff regulation. Concession holders are granted a 15-year monopoly on generation and awarding of PPAs inside their concession. Power producers that wish to feed into the network of a rural electrification concession holder must sign a PPA with that concession holder (for which no standardised form has yet been designed). Creating a more standardised template would speed the process up. Standardised PPAs for grid-connected projects are built on quality of service, which measures the number of outages and inflicts penalties for not following the rules. "
q33,SN,1,Somewhat,Developers of projects under 50kW are not subject to any electricity tariff regulation. Concession holders are granted a 15-year monopoly on generation and awarding of PPAs inside their concession. Power producers that wish to feed into the network of a rural electrification concession holder must sign a PPA with that concession holder (for which no standardised form has yet been designed).
q34,SN,1,Somewhat,State utility Senelec is obliged to take all output from renewable energy projects in the context of the PPA agreement and the grid's technical constraints. There is no such obligation on the rural electrification concession holders. Terms and conditions are decided by both parties within the frame of each PPA.
q35,SN,0,Yes,ASER and Senelec are responsible for all technical regulation in connecting projects to the grid. PPAs for connection to the main national grid are negotiated on an individual basis or within the frame of the country's renewable energy tenders. PPAs for connection to the grid of one of Senegal's concession holders are negotiated on an individual basis between concession holder and developer. Concession holders are granted a 20-year monopoly on generation and awarding of PPAs inside their concession.
q36,SN,1,Somewhat,"In some areas the grid is already very close to rural off-grid projects and so technical requirements for interconnection or co-existence of both are in place, but financial incentives still need to be set out. Holders of one of Senegal's rural electrification concessions may decide to build medium- or high-voltage interconnections to Senelec's main grid to have the national utility as one of the generators on its network. By law, all medium- and high-voltage lines in Senegal must be owned and operated by Senelec, thus, the lines must be retroceded to Senelec upon completion. However, the concession holder is incentived to connect to Senelec's network through a 20% discount on electricity purchased from the main grid. Mini-grid projects under 50kW have no obligation towards concession holders or the national power company.      "
q37,SN,1,Somewhat,ASER and Senelec are responsible for grid extension rules. A XOF 60bn ($100m) loan provided by Myna Distribution Technologies (and to be reimbursed by the Senegal government) is specifically dedicated to the purpose of grid extension.
q38,SN,1,Somewhat,"Mini-grid projects under 50kW are not subject to specific quality of service standards. The awarding of rural electrification concessions is based on a list of quality of service standards designed in collaboration with the rural electrification agency and with the support of the national power company, Senelec. Good quality of service is also incentivised through the disbursement of public subsidies at different stages of the power systems' development upon achievement of pre-defined service quality and scope achievements. There are clear quality standards for power producers fixed by ASER in concession areas, and with Senelec on the main grid. There is also an effort by German company PTB to install a quality control lab in the research center for renewable energy in Dakar. "
q39,SN,0,Yes,"The use of innovative financing structures is implicitly encouraged by the rural electrification agency. Pamiga is a Paris-based micro-finance institution providing micro-finance and loans to renewable energy projects for irrigation and agricultural purposes in Senegal, as well as offering technology development support. It is working with Caurie Micro-finance on financing pilot off-grid solar projects in the concession regions of Thies, Mbour and Tibouane, where Bonergie provides the products and Pamiga works with women groups to inform local people about the benefits of renewable energy. By the end of 2017, Pamiga expects to provide credit for between 2,500 and 3,000 solar kits. Pamiga investors include the European Investment Bank, OPIC, SDC, Rockefeller Foundation and some private investors. Pamiga is also considering funding solar boutiques in off-grid villages, where villagers could come to recharge their phones, buy or lease solar lamps and watch television. "
q41,SN,0,Yes,"Senegal started working on its extensive and ambitious rural electrification programme after the creation of the rural electrification agency (ASER) in 1999. The programme was developed hand-in-hand with international donors, notably the World Bank, and claimed to be the most ambitious on the African continent. Today, rural electrification is taking place through a number of actors, notably Senelec, rural concession holders and Peracod. The state has divided the country into 10 concession areas - six of which have been allocated, with activity seen in three of these. The final four will be allocated once activity is seen in all six already allocated. Rural electrification has risen from about 5% to 29% through these measures."
q42,SN,0,Yes,"ASER, Senegal's rural electrification agency, was established by law in 1999 and is responsible for all regulation regarding rural concessions. However, hold-ups in rural electrification projects can arise from tariff misunderstandings and a lack of purchasing power on the part of the general population. The national renewable energy agency (ANER) has been in existence since 2013 and has so far installed 1,835 solar street lights and has launched a tender to install 50,000 more. ANER has installed solar energy systems at 120 public buildings, and expects to install solar energy at 120 health centers in cooperation with the Netherlands gran facility ORIO. Peracod (the Renewable Energy Promotion Program) is another organisation involved in rural electrification. More than 110 villages have been electrified through Peracod (about 30 in the north and 70 in the south). The National Society for Eco Villages is also involved in rural electrification."
q43,SN,1,Average,"Senegal's rural electrification agency (ASER) received a state budget of XOF 19bn ($31.5m) for 2016 to put towards project electrification and running the agency. Myna Distribution Technologies will lead a XOF 60bn project on extending the national grid, according to ASER."
q44,SN,0,Yes,"Senegal's current electrification target stands at 70% by 2017. In some political discourse however, the electrification target is more in the region of 50-60%."
q45,SN,0,Yes,"The National Renewable Energy Agency (ANER) is involved in mini-grid development for social buildings such as schools and health centers, while the Rural Electrification Agency (ASER) is providing mini-grid access to families with three service levels, depending on the amount of power needed. "
q46,SN,0,Yes,"ANER has received a XOF 300m ($52,0000) grant for 2016 from the government to put towards off-grid projects, such as solar projects for schools and hospitals, in addition to XOF 600m to fund the running of the institution itself. A consortium of the Islamic Bank, African Development Bank and EU Aid will lend $58m to electrify 188 off-grid villages in Senegal over the next four years to 2020. The loan will be state-backed, according to ASER. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is also lending $13m for rural electrification, which will be state-backed. A partnership between Senegal state and the EU is also providing a EUR 15m ($17m) subsidy to electrify 100 villages. Station Energy has received funding from the National Agency of Eco Villages to pay for five 'boutiques', which rent out solar lamps to villagers for XOF 50 (8 US cents) per day, sell batteries, freeze food and have a television for people to watch. A sixth village was also funded 25% by the agency and 75% by Station Energy itself. In a village of 600 inhabitants, a village boutique is estimated to impact the lives of 250 people. African Development Bank provided an 11-year loan to a rural electrification concession that was run by the Moroccan water company. The loan period has now finished but the AfDB would provide debt financing to further concessions if asked by the state. "
q47,SN,1,Average,"According to a project led by Peracod and ASER in one region, the cost for a household to connect to the grid is estimated at between EUR 150 to 200 ($170-$230) per person, depending on distance and other variables. This compares to an estimated cost of EUR 50 to 80 per person for a solar home system. "
q48,SN,1,Somewhat,"Connection to the main grid is free for new customers within 35 metres, but there is a charge for customers beyond this radius. However, particularly in villages powered by solar energy, customers must pay a subscription fee before being connected to the grid, which can hold back the speed at which villages get electricity access. Inside one of Senegal's rural electrification concessions, new customers must pay a small initial fee, but the bulk of the connection cost is recouped over a longer period through inclusion in the electricity tariff. This tariff can be softened through the use of development finance and public subsidies. "
q49,SN,1,Somewhat,"Rural electrification holders are exempt from VAT and import duty. They also have permission to buy wholesale electricity from Senelec at a 20% discount (if the project is connected to the national grid) and receive subsidies of between 20% to 80% on project investment, depending on the region and the buying power of households. "
q50,SN,1,Somewhat,"Solar panels are exempt from paying VAT (it can be claimed back), but other electronic parts like batteries and lanterns must pay VAT. The VAT rate is 18% and other taxes at customs amount to about 25%. MicroCredit says that total import duties (see below) amounting to about 45% are a big setback for its business. It is looking to set up shop in other nearby countries where the tariffs are lower and says it wants to work with partners to pressurise the government to reduce tariffs. Solar products benefit from a reduction in import duties, but solar lanterns and batteries pay import taxes of 20% as they are classed as electronic products. "
q51,SN,0,Yes,See notes on off-grid financing facilities.
q53,SN,0,Yes,"Several distributors offer PAYG options to buyers of their products, either off their own balance sheets or via a third-party financier. Caurie provides credit for Bonergie products, for example. MicroCred is a micro-finance organisation, primarily for entrepreneurs, but it is widening its focus to individuals. MicroCred is launching a pay-as-you-go pilot in May 2016 for its SunKing solar home system and SunKing pro products, where anyone can buy the systems via small shops or village ambassadors, provided they pay a down payment of XOF 16,000 ($27) and pay XOF 350 per day (60 cents) thereafter for a period of eight months to write off the XOF 85,000 ($145) cost of the system (the system costs XOF 15,000 more with the credit offering due to interest). If customers do not pay the amount they owe then the system batteries will be locked from afar and the system will become unusable. MicroCred is also developing an off-grid mobile phone payment model. MicroCredit is affiliated with 600 shops in Senegal, but only 40 of these sell solar lamps. Nadji Bi is developing a mobile money payment system to use with Orange Money, whereby algorithums would be placed inside the system that match the customer's payment plan. The company has signed with two mobile banking companies so far and intends to run a trial here. By sticking to the payment plan, the customer receives an unlock code for the system that allows it to keep using the system. After paying the total, the system will be unlocked. Mobile money has been used in Senegal for several years, to pay electricity bills to the national power company, Senelec. It remains to be seen how quickly these proposed systems will spread to pre-paid small power systems in remote areas. Within rural electrification concessions, the use of mobile money is not necessary as consumers pay a pre-defined flat rate based on their consumption level to avoid metering costs. "
q54,SN,2,No,"Lighting Africa is a continent-wide project that introduces quality standards and testing procedures for small solar home products. Although some manufacturers are certified, it is not a legally-enforced measure, as many products being sold do not have the certification. Gaining accreditation is expensive and a company must have a large-enough manufacturing capacity to make the amounts required for assessment. There is a difficult dichotomy between solar products sold on the black market that do not pay VAT and import fees, and better quality items sold by formal distributors like Station Energy, Bonergie and MicroCred. Although stand-alone solar panels are exempt from import taxes, they are still subject to VAT, while solar inverters, regulators and batteries are classed as electronic components and must pay import taxes. A 250W solar panel on the black market costs about XOF 100,000 ($166) whereas with a formal seller it rises to XOF 176,000 ($292), according to Station Energy. "
q55,SN,2,No,Kerosene and diesel subsidies have been heavily reduced since the oil price drop.

q23,SL,1,Somewhat,"EDSA are the only entity legally allowed to sell electricity. Mini-grids are only legal for self-consumption, not for sale. However the Ministry of Energy is looking to adopt regulatory changes that will also ensure safety standards are met if mini-grids are to sell electricity."
q24,SL,2,No,"The government has not officially granted concessions, however, it is accepted that it would be too expensive to extend the grid to all of the rural areas (i.e. outside of Freetown, Bo - Kenema and Makeni). The government is also unable to grant land concessions due to the ambiguity of land ownership in many of the chiefdoms. From looking at the draft map for the grid development to 2030, there are still many settlements that will be left with no grid access (beyond 5km from grid)."
q25,SL,1,Somewhat,"There are no limit for projects that are for self-consumption. However, mini-grid projects are not allowed."
q26,SL,1,Somewhat,The main actor is the Ministry of Energy.
q27,SL,2,No,There is no dedicated team.
q28,SL,2,No,There is no defined standard procedure for developers.
q29,SL,1,Somewhat,"Power tariffs are amongst the highest in Africa, due to the high share of thermal generation, and they are adjusted regularly. These principles should create the basic conditions for developers to benefit from stable tariffs that allow for cost recovery. Nevertheless, at present these conditions need to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. However, the experience of some on-grid developers so far suggests that the government (through the grid operator EDSA) is reluctant to offer tariffs at close to or above the current retail price. Off-grid projects appear to suffer more as the additional cost of storage (batteries) means the costs are greater than the equivalent on-grid retail price. Due to political sensitivity (off-grid communities paying a higher price for electricity) the government is reluctant to agree to such tariffs."
q30,SL,1,Somewhat,"Power tariffs are amongst the highest in the continent, due to the high share of thermal generation, and they are adjusted regularly. These principles should create the basic conditions for developers to benefit from stable tariffs allowing for cost recovery.

q32,SL,2,No,"There is an official procedure to apply for a PPA, but there is no standardized PPA. PPAs are applied for on a case-by-case basis. It took the solar developer 'SolarEra' four years to secure a PPA (however, this was across a change in ministry members and an outbreak of ebola) . The application process has been designed but it has only been followed through by a few projects. The Minister of Energy was reluctant to give a timeline for the process but stressed that it will become more efficient as more PPAs are applied for. The process is as follows: Developer submits project proposal to the Energy Task Force (Minister of Energy and a team of 11); initial comments are given; passed on to the PPP (public-private partnership team) within President's office; PPP unit (including lawyers, analysts etc.) check the proposal and work on a PPA; PPA is sent back to Minister of Energy; If signed by the Minister it is passed to cabinet for approval; if approved by cabinet it is passed to the President for ratification. In summary, it appears to be a lengthy process with several hurdles for the project."
q33,SL,0,Yes,The only existing IPP (Addax) has signed a 20-year PPA. SolarEra has signed or has an offer for a 20-year PPA for a 25MW solar project (to be built in two phases).
q34,SL,1,Somewhat,Currently the grid is of limited capacity so it not always possible for the utility to accept all output. 
q35,SL,2,No,Rules need to be discussed and agreed by potential IPPs and developers.

q37,SL,1,Somewhat,"The 'Energy Sector Strategy 2014-2017' gives an overview of planned grid extension, although no real detail is available. However, the grid extension plan - 'Preparation of the Electricity Network Investment Plan' - which is applicable up to 2030, is at a late stage of editing. This will be a detailed plan that includes strengthening the current grid, connecting proposed hydro projects across the country, connecting new areas of the country and integrating the 'Western Africa Power Pool (WAPP)' line to the country's grid. The WAPP line will connect to Liberia in the South to Guinea in the North."
q38,SL,2,No,No plan has been developed yet to promote SPPs.
q39,SL,2,No,There is currently no evidence to suggest power producers are also offering financial services to customers.
q41,SL,1,Somewhat,There is an Energy Access Project that promotes rural electrification and is lead by the Ministry of Energy. Two rural hydro minigrids are under construction (Bankasoka and Charlotte). The programme is still too small to make a substantial impact.
q42,SL,2,No,"No, but there is a rural electrification department at the Ministry of Energy."
q43,SL,2,Low,"There is no annual budget. The Ministry of Energy uses available funds mainly for emergency maintenance and upgrading the grid. For grid extension the Ministry of Energy must seek all funding from donors. Grid extension plans are on a project by project basis.

q46,SL,1,Somewhat,"There is no finance available from the government nor commercial finance, but there is some indication that funding might be available through SREP.  This works through off-grid developers/ mini-grids submitting projects to the government. They are then filtered for bankability by the African Development Bank and the World Bank to form a portfolio. The portfolio as a whole submits a bid for funding from SREP, which is named Climate Investment funds. Also, 'brac' is an example of a company that offers micro-finance to consumers, enabling them to buy home energy kits."
q47,SL,1,Average,"Connection cost is around SLL 1m ($180), an additional SLL 500,000 is need to finance a meter and further costs for building materials and to pay a technician.  This can include building a transmission pole unless a friendly neighbour allows you to use his/hers. In theory it should be free to install but technicians typically need an unofficial payment for a timely and proper installation. Another quote was around SLL 700-800, 000 for the meter plus the price of cable; equating to around SLL 1m."

For example, solar products will at a minimum require certificates from the Ministry of Energy and Ministry of Finance. Obtaining the certificates is often time-consuming and can require unofficial payments. Even with the certificates in hand, it is likely that further unofficial payments to port officials will be needed in order to collect the goods. These payments are seen as an additional cost on the goods for retailers, ultimately passed on to consumers. International companies often employ a ""fixer"" - somebody with know-how that can obtain the best ""deals"" at the port for the retailers. However, a renowned fixer comes at a price. Even after collecting the goods, importers often find that cases have been opened and items or parts are missing. To avoid the bureaucracy and unofficial payment it is not unheard of for importers to deliver their good to Conakry (Guinea) and drive the goods down to Sierra Leone. Conkary is a free port (no duties), but when crossing the border back from Sierra Leone the local chiefs seek some form of payment."
q60,SL,1,Somewhat,"A new business needs a 'Business Registration License' from the Registrar General office, under Business Registration Act No.13/1983. There are mixed reviews as to the efficiency of the process, ranging from the license being ""very easy to get"", to cumbersome and bureaucratic. SLIEPA (Sierra Leone Export and Investment Promotion) defines the process for setting up a new business in Sierra Leone."
q61,SL,2,Low,
q23,TZ,0,Yes,"The Small Power Producers Framework was established to encourage the construction of small power plants, whether on or off the grid."
q24,TZ,2,No,"There are no concessions for mini-grid developers. However, the government has plans under development. At the very least, by June 2025, distribution is due to be unbundled from the transmission segment and a number of zones are to be set up for 'zonal distribution companies'."
q25,TZ,1,Somewhat,Power plants must be under 10MW in order to benefit from the Small Power Producers Framework. The plant's capacity may be more than this threshold but the facility may only export power at the interconnection point up to 10MW. 
q26,TZ,1,Somewhat,"The energy regulator, Ewura, is the main body responsible dealing with regulation."
q27,TZ,1,Somewhat,"Tanesco has a dedicated small power-projects office, which aims to reduce the bureaucratic load on developers by handling enquiries and advising on permits and technical requirements."
q28,TZ,0,Yes,"Project developers can access a list of electricity licence requirements, licence application forms and relevant legislation on the regulator's website. In addition, the regulator has worked to minimise the amount of information required for a decision, as well as the number of separate regulatory requirements and decisions. It also aims to use standardised documents to reduce the need for case-by-case analysis and time-consuming negotiations."
q29,TZ,2,No,"According to the Electricity Act, tariffs should be cost-reflective and allow licensees to make a fair return on their investments. Indeed, one aim of the 2015 National Energy Policy is to ""ensure cost-reflective tariffs to attract private investments,"" but this goal has yet to be implemented in practice."
q30,TZ,0,Yes,"The second Small Power Producers Framework introduced fixed tariffs, while under the preceding version the tariffs were set annually on an avoided-cost basis."
q31,TZ,0,Yes,"Under the second Small Power Producers Framework, implemented in 2015, the fixed tariffs will be set administratively (based on technology costs) for small hydro and biomass projects, and through competitive auctions for wind and solar. The regulator will set the tariffs for new very small power plants (up to 1MW) using wind and solar, or they will be equal to the published tariff for a 500kW biomass project plus a premium of: 15% for those connected to the isolated mini-grid, and 5% for those connected to the main grid. Small power plants may propose a retail tariff structure, including conventional kWh tariffs, flat tariffs, power tariffs or a combination of these. "
q32,TZ,0,Yes,"Tanzania has led the way in the region with regards regulatory framework and incentives to support small power projects. Since 2008, plants of up to 10MW have been subject to standardised PPAs. In 2015, the government issued 'model PPAs' for seven technologies (hydro, gas, oil, coal, geothermal, solar and wind) to be used as guidance for projects exceeding 10MW. This was one of the milestones of the 2014 Electricity Sector Reform Strategy and Roadmap."
q33,TZ,0,Yes,"Both the standardised PPAs for small power projects and the model PPAs for larger projects have a 25-year duration. The second Small Power Producers Framework introduced fixed tariffs, while under the preceding version the tariffs were set annually on an avoided cost basis."
q34,TZ,0,Yes,"The standardised PPA is a 'take or pay' contract - i.e., the DNO must purchase all of the net electric energy output, not exceeding the contracted capacity, generated by the plant."
q35,TZ,0,Yes,The Electricity (Development of Small Power Plants) Rules 2015 explains interconnection and testing responsibilities. The DNO will bear interconnection costs up to 10km from its substation.
q36,TZ,0,Yes,"Grid arrival rules are now clear. The second Small Power Producers Framework specifies that both grid-connected and mini-grid projects receive the same tariff. Therefore, when the main grid arrives in an area, any existing mini-grid projects will not have to change tariffs."
q37,TZ,1,Somewhat,"The government can be transparent in its grid-extension plans. However, each part of government – whether the Rural Energy Agency, energy ministry, EWURA, TANESCO, etc. – has its own plan, which makes it confusing for developers."
q38,TZ,0,Yes,"Safety, reliability, voltage and frequency standards for mini-grids are publicly available."
q39,TZ,0,Yes,"Tanzania has been one of the growth areas for off-grid solar companies offering solar home systems. This emerging market has been enabled by the use of pay-as-you-go technology and mobile money, which allows distributers to pre-finance their products."
q41,TZ,0,Yes,"The Rural Energy Agency (REA) is responsible for Tanzania's rural electrification programme. It works to promote and facilitate rural energy development by working with the private sector, NGOs and government agencies."
q42,TZ,0,Yes,The Rural Energy Agency (REA) is an independent body under the Ministry of Energy and Minerals. Its objective is to facilitate and promote access to modern energy services in rural parts of mainland Tanzania.
q43,TZ,1,Average,"Some TZS 357bn ($164m) was allocated to rural electrification in the 2015/16 budget. The government aims to electrify 75% of households by 2035, with a target to connect 250,000 new customers annually during 2013-17. The vast majority of the government's electrification activities have revolved around connecting new customers to the main grid. This will include connecting the remaining isolated systems in Ruvuma Kigoma, Kagera, Rukwa, Lindi and Mtwara by 2019. In 2013/14 -- the latest year for which data are available -- some 0.2% of the rural electrification budget was spent on off-grid activities."
q44,TZ,0,Yes,"The government was aiming to reach 30% connectivity by 2050 – a target that has recently been achieved. Its goal now is to reach 33% by 2018, 40% by 2021 and 50% by 2025. It plans to reach 75% by 2035. To achieve these goals, in 2012 the government set a new target to connect 250,000 urban, peri-urban and rural customers per year."
q45,TZ,2,No,"The 2015 National Energy Policy, ESIRS and Power Sector Master Plan do not state whether the energy access targets or strategies include off-grid and mini-grid developments. The 'National Electrification Program Prospectus', created by the IED and funded by NORAD, covers electrification by connection to the main grid or mini-grid, or off-grid. But it notes that the government  aims to “mainly electrify customers by connection to the main grid,” in particular, those settlements “within 10 km of the main grid and containing at least 500 inhabitants”."
q46,TZ,0,Yes,"Development banks have historically supported off- and mini-grid development in Tanzania. AFD has established a EUR 20m credit line for renewable and rural energy. DFID also has a GBP 30m regional soft loan facility that can finance renewable energy investments. The UK Department for International Development is preparing a regional mini-grid facility for Tanzania, while the US Agency for International Development and KfW are also considering supporting mini-grids. The European Union has already supported five mini-grids in the country. In addition, they have supported off-grid companies: eg, Off Grid Electric has raised debt financing from USAID, among others."
q47,TZ,0,High,"This is the average connection fee for a single-phase connection close to the grid. In a rural area, this charge would vary between $68 and $176 (excluding VAT), depending on the distance to the grid. This range is $124-269 for urban areas. The costs for a three-phase line are substantially higher, reaching $634 where two poles are required within 120 meters of the grid.  The connection fees were substantially reduced in 2013 to encourage people to sign up: the charges were cut by 60-75% in rural areas and 29-60% in urban areas. However, in addition to the connection fees, customers still have to pay out of pocket for internal wiring, which presents a barrier to scaling up household connections in low-income, predominantly rural areas. "
q48,TZ,1,Somewhat,The Rural Energy Fund provides grants towards the capital costs of projects implemented by private as well as public entities. The connection subsidy can reduce the charge to as low as $20 and it can as high as $500 for mini-grids.
q49,TZ,0,Yes,"The Rural Energy Fund provides grants towards the capital costs of projects (but not towards operating or debt-service costs). It also offers technical assistance, training and other forms of capacity building, as well as financial assistance in pilot and demonstration projects. Loans from local commercial banks are also supported by a $25m World Bank credit line."
q50,TZ,0,Yes,
q51,TZ,0,Yes,"There are multiple examples: TEDAP (Tanzania Energy Development and Access Project) off-grid component is a programme launched by the REA and supported by the World Bank and Global Environmental Facility, to help off-grid and renewable energy projects. The on-grid component of the project included $114m for TANESCO to upgrade its transmission and distribution networks. The 'Lighting Rural Tanzania' competition was funded by the World Bank in partnership with the REA. The contest focused on improving access to energy and lighting in schools and health facilities in rural Tanzania.  The 'One Million Solar Homes' project aims to install solar power on 1m homes by 2017. It is funded by the REA and various development agencies and implemented by Off-Grid Electric."
q53,TZ,0,Yes,The Angaza Energy Hub is a web interface that enables companies to manage their PAYG distribution operations. 
q54,TZ,1,Somewhat,"Since 2007, Tanzania has set requirements for PV systems, including how the product and its components work. But these only apply to traditional home solar arrays. As a result, the government may consider setting standards on pico-solar products based on the 'Lighting Global' standard. Low quality solar products have tarnished citizens' view of the technology. In recent years, Tanzania saw a wave of low quality and fake products enter the country, prompting the Bureau of Standards to undertake a market surveillance exercise in 2015.  On the supply side, a customs official verifies products at the point of origin before a container is shipped to Dar es Salaam. Still, poor products are being imported. There are standards in place for solar and pre-verification of shipments. "
q55,TZ,2,No,"In principal, subsidies on petroleum products were abolished in 2000 when the industry was liberalised, according to the 2015 National Energy Policy. Historically, kerosene has had a lower excise duty than other petroleum products. But in 2011, this duty differential was removed, eliminating the indirect subsidy. "
q56,TZ,2,Low,"The following are exempt from VAT: solar panels, modules, solar charger controllers, solar inverter, solar lights, vacuum tube solar collectors and solar batteries. Otherwise the standard VAT rate of 18% applies."
q57,TZ,0,Yes,"The following are exempt from VAT: solar panels, modules, solar charger controllers, solar inverter, solar lights, vacuum tube solar collectors and solar batteries. Otherwise the standard VAT rate of 18% applies."
q58,TZ,0,Yes,"As a member of the East African Community, PV cells are exempt from import duties, as are solar lanterns. However, solar home systems up to 1,000V are subject to a rate of 10% and batteries up to 25%."
q59,TZ,0,Yes,"Historically, import delays have proved a challenge, to the extent that some small retailers have stopped selling solar home systems. In addition, some project developers would import goods through Kenya and then transport them via road to Tanzania, which could prove problematic due to the poor road infrastructure. However, President John Magufuli, who came to power in 2015, has been working to revamp the port as part of his anti-corruption drive, although it is too early to know if this campaign will help to accelerate the import process. Moreover, industry players confirm that they are aware that imported goods can be delayed as they transit the port, and as such, they factor this additional time into their planning schedules."
q60,TZ,1,Somewhat,"The overall awareness and understanding of off-grid solar products among target customers remains a stumbling block. Retailers often say that purchased goods are returned damaged due to misuse by accident. As mentioned above, the influx of low-quality goods has also hurt some consumers' perception of this technology. "
q61,TZ,2,Low,
q23,UG,0,Yes,"Development of minigrids and small power projects is supported in Uganda by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA). The agency encourages these projects in areas where connection to the grid is unlikely in the near to medium term. However, the financing of minigrid generation remains scarce as most projects are unlikely to be profitable without subsidy, which is outside of REA's mandate. In some instances, the government has provided the necessary support and a number of pilots are under way investigating optimal business models for minigrids."
q24,UG,2,No,"Concessions are granted to operate new sections of the grid as it develops, however, no corresponding approach is currently in place for off-grid or minigrid development. The one exception is the Bugala Island minigrid in Lake Victoria, which is operated on concession by Kalangala Infrastructure services. Currently, the Ugandan Government is seeking development of 15 minigrid projects in conjunction with GIZ. A concession to develop and operate these systems will be auctioned to private developers soon, but there is no concrete policy to support this process."
q25,UG,1,Somewhat,"In principal there is no limit to the size of a mini-grid or small power project. However, to apply for a license exemption, which streamlines the development process and reduces the amount of applicable standards and regulations, generation capacity much be less than 2MW. All generation connected to the main grid must apply for a license regardless of size, so license exemptions only apply to off-grid or minigrid projects."
q26,UG,1,Somewhat,"The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) is the lead actor for all matters related to electricity regulation, this is true for both off- and on-grid. Although a number of stakeholders play an important role in off-grid project development, ERA is the sole regulatory body."
q27,UG,2,No,Mini-grid development is not a priority for any of the state utilities and they do not have teams specifically focused on this. 
q28,UG,1,Somewhat,"Arguably, by providing license exemptions for projects with less than 2MW of capacity, the regulator is minimising transaction costs and the regulatory burden. However, developing a minigrid is far from a streamlined process, with multiple actors that must be consulted."
q29,UG,0,Yes,"Mini-grid developers with a licence exemption can apply to the regulator to set both the amount and structure of the tariff. In principal, it is open to the developer to modify the tariff as long as it is cost-reflective and fair for the local community. On-grid tariffs are topped up by the GET-FiT premium, which has attracted outside investment. Now that the programme is winding down, the national FiTs are being revised with new rates due to be published by the end of 2016."
q30,UG,0,Yes,Off-grid tariffs should be set by the developer in accordance with the regulator. Considerable work has gone into attracting on-grid developers through the tariff scheme so there is nothing to suggest that these would be retroactively revised in future.
q31,UG,0,Yes,"Mini-grid developers with a licence exemption can apply to the regulator to set both the amount and structure of the tariff. In principle, it is open to the developer to modify the tariff as long as it is cost-reflective and fair for the local community. On-grid projects receive payment as stipulated by the standardised PPA and feed-in-tariff set by the regulator."
q32,UG,0,Yes,"A standardised PPA exists for on-grid power projects, which was one of the cornerstones of the GET FiT process, together with a standardised implementation agreement. These are used for all new generation projects and can be found here: http://www.era.or.ug/index.php/licences-permits/2013-10-15-15-44-39/application-renewal-forms"
q33,UG,0,Yes,The PPA has a duration of 20 to 25 years. Extensive work was undertaken by the regulator and international development groups in collaboration with the private sector to ensure that the terms of the PPA are bankable. 
q34,UG,0,Yes,"The PPA obliges the TSO, UETCL, to take all generation output. In practice, however, connection to the grid remains an issue. Some projects are not connected to transmission lines with enough capacity to evacuate all their power -- causing some generated energy to be wasted. However, the PPA stipulates that the generator is fully compensated for this 'deemed energy' (as it is known)."
q35,UG,0,Yes,"Generators are required to pay for and develop the first 5km of any connection. If the line is above 33kV then UETCL is responsible for development beyond 5km; if it is less than or equal to 33kV then the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) is the responsible party. Once built, operation of the line is handed over to UETCL, REA or one of the nine distribution companies. However, some developers are unclear as to whose responsibility it is to maintain and operate certain new lines."
q36,UG,2,No,Currently there are no clear rules regarding connection of the main grid to minigrids. This presents a significant risk to developers as UETCL is unlikely to purchase power from the local producer once the grid arrives but customers will be grid-connected. The developer will not be compensated for this loss. Authorities are aware of this challenge and are working on measures to address the issue.
q37,UG,2,No,"The Rural Electrification Agency updates its plans annually but these are hard to access. Currently a 10-year plan is under development, due to be released in 2017, but this will not be updated annually so will only be of short-term use. Likewise UETCL transmission plans are hard to access and private sector and development groups allege that the planning process is haphazard and difficult to understand."
q38,UG,1,Somewhat,"Projects with a licence exemption must still meet the same safety and grid loss standards as grid-connected projects. However, they are not required to meet other quality of service standards."
q39,UG,1,Somewhat,This is regulated independently of energy. Producers wishing to offer financial services to consumers will need to seek approval and licensing from the Uganda Investment Authority.
q41,UG,0,Yes,"In 2001, the government decided to implement a programme of rural electrification and in 2003 the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) was established. The first plan ran from 2003 to 2012. In 2013 the second 10-year action plan began with a target of reaching 22% rural electrification by 2022 from 7% in 2013."
q42,UG,0,Yes,"The Rural Electrification Agency (REA) was established in 2003 and is focused on connecting people in non-dense-urban environments. For example, it will help connect residents in small towns located near the grid but will not help residents in the capital, Kampala. REA is fully responsible for the building of new distribution lines, defined as equal to or below 33kV, and connecting Ugandan residents in relevant areas. Essentially all new distribution lines built in Uganda outside of Umeme's service territory will be financed and owned by REA. Its mandate requires it to equally distribute projects throughout the country."
q43,UG,0,High,"Uganda's fiscal year runs July through June so we estimate the 2015 budget by combining half of the 2014/15 and 2015/16 annual budgets. Roughly a third of the budget comes from the Government of Uganda, a third from UETCL and a third from international donors. A 5% levy is placed on the cost of energy purchases made by UETCL that is used to fund the REA. Some capital is available to off-grid solar companies through the Uganda Energy Credit Capitalisation Company but this is provided outside of the Rural Electrification Agency and its budget."
q44,UG,0,Yes,"REA's objective is to achieve a rural electrification rate of 22% by 2022, up from 5% in 2012. This corresponds to approximately 1.42m new rural connections of which 1.28m will be on-grid and 140,000 off-grid. The total cost of this plan is expected to be $920m."
q45,UG,0,Yes,"Of the 1.42m new connections planned, 140,000 are expected to come online by developing minigrids and installing solar-PV systems."
q46,UG,2,No,"Currently no mechanism is in place for financing off-grid companies. However, the Uganda Energy Credit Capitalisation Company is introducing a working capital facility in the 2015/16 fiscal year for off-grid solar companies. Various international development groups have at different stages provided subsidies and loans for customers acquiring the systems."
q47,UG,2,Low,"The base upfront cost is $42.97 made up of a $12.74 (UGX 41,300) inspection fee and $30.23 (UGX 98,000) connection fee. For customer's further away from the grid who require new poles, the connection fee increases to $100.57 (UGX 326,000), making the total cost of connection $113.1."
q48,UG,1,Somewhat,"No connection grants or subsidies are offered directly by REA, but other assistance is available. The World Bank and other international development groups offer financial assistance to subsidise households and business wishing to connect. Also, the Uganda Energy Credit Capitalisation Company provides connection loans through the domestical financial institution Centenary Bank."
q49,UG,2,No,"REA's mandate does not include generation so no grants are provided for mini-grid developers. International development agencies such as GIZ support mini-grid development so financial assistance may be available for developers there. As mini-grid generation of less than 2MW is exempt from licensing, this avoids the cost of licensing fees which are in the range of $2,500-6,000 a year."
q50,UG,0,Yes,
q51,UG,0,Yes,Off-grid market building organisations exist within the country and are supported primarily by international development groups. The government has made off-grid solar and electrification a priority over the coming year and it is likely more effort will be placed on raising awareness of off-grid technologies amongst the rural population.
q53,UG,1,Somewhat,"There are several companies in Uganda retailing PAYG solar systems, ranging from pico-systems to kW size for commercial customers. Most of these companies use their own PAYG platform and sell their own products. One exception is a company that prefers to supply the products and leave the retail element to a local distributor."
q54,UG,1,Somewhat,Solar products must comply with standards laid out by the Uganda National Bureau of Standards which stipulates both compulsory and voluntary standards. It is not clear how effectively these are enforced but some vendors reported that they ensured compliance.
q55,UG,2,No,Uganda does not subsidise the cost of kerosene and diesel or any other cooking fuels. However kerosene and diesel are VAT-exempt.
q56,UG,2,Low,"Off-grid solar products are VAT exempt. This extends to the whole of the solar system including the cables inverter and battery if sold together. However it does not apply to parts and components separately, nor solar appliances such as televisions and fridges."
q57,UG,0,Yes,The standard VAT rate in Uganda is 18%. A 0% rate is applied to off-grid solar products.
q58,UG,0,Yes,Off-grid solar products are import tariff exempt. This extends to the whole of the solar system including the cables inverter and battery if shipped together. However suppliers have reported difficulties with import exemption when shipping components such as cables and batteries separately to solar panels.
q59,UG,1,Somewhat,"Some companies alleged that corruption could be an issue at customs. Additionally, the Uganda Revenue Authority does extensive testing on products to check that they are eligible for exemptions, and this can halt the import process."
q60,UG,1,Somewhat,"There are excessive public holidays, particularly in December -- which is a peak selling period. Quality of staff was a recurring theme among companies. It can be challenging training staff to an adequate level for them to perform well in a high-growth company. The fact that the product being sold is somewhat technical, further complicates the sales process."
q61,UG,2,Low,
q23,ZM,0,Yes,"There are an three minigrids in the country - one hydro, one solar and one biomass. These are supported by the Rural Electrification Authority."
q24,ZM,0,Yes,"Licenses designate a territory around the minigrid area, which offers the owner some protection against competition from the grid, effectively a concession agreement."
q25,ZM,1,Somewhat,"Regulations apply for projects or minigrids above 100kW. The regulator will normally let self-supply or community-supply projects go without a license, but if it is a commercial entity selling electricity to consumers, even below 100kW, the regulator will demand a licence."
q26,ZM,1,Somewhat,This is the Energy Regulation Board.
q27,ZM,1,Somewhat,"The commercial team in the utility is responsible for any power producers selling power to the grid but there is no official, separate minigrid or small-project team."
q28,ZM,0,Yes,"The regulator strives for a light-handed approach. It will assess price and technical set up but does not place a prohibitive burden on small power projects. For instance, there is a combined license to generate, distribute and supply electricity at a small-scale, where each of these elements requires a separate licence at large scale."
q29,ZM,0,Yes,"The regulator will check that prices are cost-reflective, but will not specify a level."
q30,ZM,1,Somewhat,"The regulator reserves the right to check tariffs are cost-reflective, and there is a contract provision for price review."
q31,ZM,0,Yes,The developer has relative freedom to set price levels.
q32,ZM,1,Somewhat,This is starting to be deployed through the 'Scaling Solar' and 'REFiT' (renewable energy feed-in tariff) programmes. There is no standardised PPA available at the utility.
q33,ZM,0,Yes,"The PPA duration under 'Scaling Solar' is 25 years, which is sufficient to be bankable."
q34,ZM,2,No,PPAs have to be secured and Zesco is not obliged to purchase the power.
q35,ZM,0,Yes,"Projects below 20MW in the 'REFiT' (renewable energy feed-in tariff) will use standard regulation in the PPAs. Projects above 20MW will use the normal grid rules, agreed in a PPA with Zesco."
q36,ZM,1,Somewhat,"The licence for small power projects and minigrids protects the area of service, meaning that the state utility cannot take customers when the grid arrives. More clarification is needed to allow these projects to connect when the grid arrives."
q37,ZM,1,Somewhat,The Office for Promoting Private Power Investment has grid extension plans that are accessible to new developers. The utility does not make plans available online.
q38,ZM,1,Somewhat,NA
q39,ZM,2,No,Unknown but there are no current examples.
q41,ZM,0,Yes,The Rural Electrification Agency runs the Rural Electrification Fund for grid extension and small renewable power projects.
q42,ZM,0,Yes,The Rural Electrification Agency.
q43,ZM,2,Low,The amount for rural electrification is set in the country's budget. This is the 2016 total. The Rural Electrification Agency receives funding from international development partners in addition. Estimates are that no more than 20% is spent on off-grid.
q44,ZM,0,Yes,The main document is the Rural Electrification Master Plan. It was published in 2008 and aims to increase electrification in rural areas from 3% to 51% by 2030. We estimate the current level of rural electrification at 5% (see energy data section). The Rural Electrification Authority estimates that this will cost about $50m/yr over the period 2008-30.
q45,ZM,1,Somewhat,The Rural Electrification Agency's remit involves developing off-grid energy projects but has no specific targets.
q46,ZM,0,Yes,Power Africa Beyond the Grid and the Swedish Development Agency are two organisations active in this area.
q47,ZM,1,Average,"An estimate was provided by the African Development Bank which in local currency is ZMK 1,783,666 ($1800)."
q48,ZM,2,No,
q49,ZM,2,No,"The Rural Electrification Agency has a programme to install off-grid solar and hydro projects, but it builds and operates these itself. There are no grants for mini-grid operators."
q50,ZM,2,No,
q51,ZM,0,Yes,Power Africa Beyond the Grid and the Swedish Development Agency are both active in this area.
q53,ZM,1,Somewhat,"There is some availability of pay-as-you-go, but it is much more limited than other countries."
q54,ZM,2,No,"The Zambia Bureau of Standards is developing standards for solar panels, but these are still in draft stages."
q55,ZM,0,Yes,The true cost is estimated as 30% higher than the retail sale price.

q23,ZW,0,Yes,"The regulatory framework is fairly simple in terms of applying for a license, and the holder of the license may then sell-on to transmission and distribution companies. All projects larger than 100kW are required to receive a licence from ZERA, but the process is relatively simple. There is no specific legislation pertaining to mini grids, but from what developers have said, it is not hard to set up."
q24,ZW,2,No,There is no evidence of such concessions to date.
q25,ZW,0,Yes,There is currently no limit on the size of projects in the regulatory framework.
q26,ZW,1,Somewhat,Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority is charged with managing the electricity and fuels sector.
q27,ZW,1,Somewhat,The utility has a business development and planning department which IPPs would deal with.
q28,ZW,1,Somewhat,To receive a generating license is relatively simple. The forms for it are standardised but there are no real examples for mini grids.
q29,ZW,1,Somewhat,"Developers of mini grids have been able to set up their own tariffs and business models to run the grids, and need to have them approved by the regulator."
q30,ZW,1,Somewhat,"While there are limited examples in Zimbabwe, PPAs do include long-term price agreements. There has been difficulty in negotiating a reliable rate with the regulator."
q31,ZW,0,Yes,The organisations that are running mini grids in the country have been able to use their own business models for the projects. The only real examples are NGOs that generally work hand-in-hand with REA.
q32,ZW,2,No,No documents regarding structured PPAs exist.
q33,ZW,1,Somewhat,"From conversations with multiple developers, PPAs are meant to be of sufficient duration to be bankable.  For example, ZPC issued 300MW of solar tenders for a 20-year period.  Nonetheless, there are no examples of existing/operational PPAs of such length."
q34,ZW,2,No,Only projects that have signed a PPA with ZETDC are able to sell to the utility.
q35,ZW,2,No,There are no clear precedents as to what will happen when the grid arrives.
q36,ZW,1,Somewhat,"Owners of mini grids will be required to negotiate an offtake agreement with ZETDC to sell their power into the grid but there are currently no examples of this happening. Mini grid expansion is a tenet of Zimbabwe's INDC commitments, but no coordinated effort currently exists to regulate these en masse."
q37,ZW,2,No,There is currently no forthcoming documentation on planned grid extensions.
q38,ZW,2,No,"While projects need to go through the licensing procedure laid out by ZERA, there are no set standards that developers have to comply with."
q39,ZW,1,Somewhat,"One IPP is currently exploring issuing a bond for grid-scale solar development, with regulator approval, but no examples of banking services exist."
q41,ZW,0,Yes,"Since 2002 a programme has been in place and two components exist within it: these are the expanded rural electrification programme and the electricity end-use infrastructure development programme.  The programme appears to be inactive as of 2016 due to inadequate funding, but its original coal was to electrify 10389 institutions countrywide.  As of 2011, 6424 institutions , or 62%, were electrified."
q42,ZW,0,Yes,The Zimbabwe Rural Electrification Authority.
q43,ZW,0,High,"The REA budget comes from a 6% levy added on to electricity tariffs and from additional funding made available by government or donors.  REA aims to electrify all rural institutions (including all schools, clinics, government extension offices, ex. veterinary, police, community & recreational halls, local government, etc.)"
q44,ZW,0,Yes,Zimbabwe is working toward universal access to clean energy by 2030 under its National Energy Policy implementation strategy from 2012. No progress updates have been set out as of late.
q45,ZW,0,Yes,"As part of Zimbabwe's INDC, $3bn is being allocated toward solar powered off-grid installations over the next 15 years."
q46,ZW,2,No,
q47,ZW,1,Average,"The base upfront cost for a new household grid connection is quoted at $110 by ZESA as of September 2013.  The prior price was $98, which was then increased to $465 to try and address ZESA's liquidity issues, before being lowered to $110. Further details for costs by distance from grid or add-on costs were not readily available."
q48,ZW,2,No,"All schools, clinics, government offices and chief homesteads receive a 100% subsidy while other programmes receive a 60% subsidy but households do not receive a subsidy."
q49,ZW,1,Somewhat,"There are tax incentives on offer for infrastructure projects but they need to be over $500,000 and have a local ownership exceeding 51%."
q50,ZW,2,No,
q51,ZW,2,No,
q53,ZW,1,Somewhat,"Solar Access, a division of TeleAccess Zimbabwe, offers PAYG access for Azuri Technologies solar products."
q54,ZW,2,No,
q55,ZW,2,No,
q56,ZW,1,Medium,It appears that the standard 15% VAT on solar and electrical equipment is applied to off-grid pico solar products as well.
q57,ZW,2,No,
q58,ZW,0,Yes,"Solar products receive import duty exemptions, although stakeholders feel the laws are outdated and importers don't receive full benefit."
q59,ZW,1,Somewhat,"The sector is seeing steady growth due to import duty exemptions, although the quality is on the low side, and the majority of consumers can't afford high-cost renewable systems.  No other import-related barriers exist."
q60,ZW,1,Somewhat,"No other barriers or business licensing requirements were discovered to prevent the retail of off-grid solar products.  These can be purchased anywhere from a developer for custom solutions, to a big-box department store off the shelf."
q61,ZW,2,Low,
